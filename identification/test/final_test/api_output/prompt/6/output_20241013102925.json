{
    "embed_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the embedding, which is also referred to as hidden size in Transformers. It affects how information flows through each layer and influences model capacity.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Number of attention heads used by the Transformer's multi-head self-attention mechanism, which impacts parallelism in computation and affects how information is distributed across different head dimensions.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Dimension of rotary positional embeddings used to incorporate position-awareness into the attention mechanism, which influences model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and context in sequences.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Scaling factor applied before computing softmax for QK^T matrix. It affects the stability of attention score computation, especially when dealing with high-dimensional embeddings or large sequence lengths.",
    "causal": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Boolean indicating whether to apply a causal mask in self-attention mechanism. It is crucial for autoregressive models where future tokens should not influence past ones, impacting the model's ability to generate sequences.",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Tuple defining left and right window sizes in local attention mechanism. It restricts each query token¡¯s context to a sliding window, which can be used for efficient computation of long sequences while maintaining locality.",
    "rotary_interleaved": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Boolean indicating whether rotary embeddings are interleaved. It affects how positional information is applied to the query and key vectors, impacting model's ability to capture relative positions in sequences.",
    "alibi_slopes": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Slope values for ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) mechanism. It introduces a bias that decays linearly as the distance between tokens increases, which can help in capturing long-range dependencies.",
    "cache_seqlens": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.forward, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Sequence lengths of cached keys and values. It is used to manage incremental decoding by keeping track of the sequence length for each batch element in cache."
