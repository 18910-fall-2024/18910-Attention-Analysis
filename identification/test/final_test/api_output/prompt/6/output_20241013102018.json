    "embed_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the embedding, which is also referred to as hidden size in Transformers. It affects how information flows through each layer and impacts model performance.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Number of attention heads used by the Transformer's multi-head self-attention mechanism, which influences parallelism in computation and affects how information is distributed across different head dimensions.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Dimension of rotary embeddings used for positional encoding. It impacts the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and affects performance in tasks requiring understanding of sequence order.",
