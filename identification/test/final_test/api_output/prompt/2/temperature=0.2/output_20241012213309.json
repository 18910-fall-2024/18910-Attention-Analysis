{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the model's hidden states. It is used to determine various dimensions in Transformer layers such as embedding and attention.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of heads for multi-head self-attention mechanism, which splits the input into multiple parts (heads) that are processed independently before being concatenated back together. It is used to determine dimensions in attention layers.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension per head within a Transformer's MultiHeadAttention layer; it determines how much information each individual 'head' of the multi-head self-attention mechanism processes.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The dimension used for rotary position embeddings, which are applied to queries and keys in attention layers. It is crucial for modeling positional information without affecting the sequence length.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The length of sequences being processed by Transformer models or functions; it affects how attention mechanisms handle input data and cache updates during inference.",
    "batch_size": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of samples in a batch. It determines the shape of tensors passed to `fwd_kvcache` for parallel processing or training purposes."
