{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the model's hidden states. It is used to determine various dimensions in Transformer layers such as QKV projection and MLP.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads, which affects how input embeddings are split for parallel processing during self-attention operations. It is a key hyperparameter that influences the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality (size) of each head in multi-head attention, calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads`. This parameter determines how much information can be processed by a single attention mechanism per step and is crucial for balancing model capacity with computational efficiency.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the rotary positional embedding. It influences the size of embeddings used to incorporate position-awareness in self-attention mechanisms, enhancing performance on tasks requiring understanding of sequence order and context.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The length or number of tokens (sequence length) for the input sequences. This parameter is critical in determining how far back an attention mechanism can look when processing each token.",
    "batch_size": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.allocate_inference_cache, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of samples processed at once during training or inference. It affects memory usage and parallelization efficiency but does not directly influence the model architecture beyond batch normalization layers."
