    "embed_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the embedding, which is also equal to num_heads * head_dim.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Number of attention heads in multi-head self-attention mechanism. It affects how input data are split and processed for parallel computation, impacting the model's architecture and behavior.",

    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.forward] Scaling factor applied before computing the softmax of QK^T in self-attention mechanism. It affects how much each dot product is scaled down to prevent overflow and improve numerical stability.",
    "causal": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.forward] Boolean indicating whether the attention mask should be causal (i.e., only attend to previous positions). This parameter determines if future tokens can influence current token predictions during inference or training.",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.forward] Tuple indicating the left and right window size for local attention. It restricts each query to attend only within a sliding window of keys around its position."
