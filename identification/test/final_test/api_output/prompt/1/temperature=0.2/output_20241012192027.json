    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the model's hidden states. It is used to determine various dimensions in Transformer layers such as embedding and attention.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of heads for multi-head self-attention mechanism, which splits the total dimension into multiple smaller subspaces (heads).",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The size of each head in a multi-headed attention layer. It is derived from `dim` and used to determine dimensions within Transformer layers.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Dimension for rotary positional embeddings, which are applied during the forward pass of attention mechanisms. It is crucial in determining how much rotation to apply and affects performance.",
