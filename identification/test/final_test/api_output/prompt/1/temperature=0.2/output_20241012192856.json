{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the model's hidden states. It is used to determine various dimensions in Transformer layers such as QKV projection.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads, which determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied within the model's architecture.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality (size) of each head in multi-head attention. It is derived from `dim` and `num_heads`, used to calculate Q, K, V dimensions for self-attention operations.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The dimension of the rotary embedding. It is a hyperparameter that influences how positional information is encoded in attention mechanisms, affecting model performance and efficiency with respect to long-range dependencies.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] Sequence length of the input sequence. It determines the size along the sequence dimension for tensors involved in attention operations such as Q (queries), K (keys), and V (values).",
