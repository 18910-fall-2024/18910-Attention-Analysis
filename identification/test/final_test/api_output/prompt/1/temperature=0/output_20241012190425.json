{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the model's hidden states. It is used to determine various dimensions in Transformer layers such as QKV projection and MLP.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads, which determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied within the model's architecture. It is used to calculate head dimensions in multi-head attention layers.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality (size) of each individual attention head; it equals `embed_dim` divided by `num_heads`. This parameter helps define tensor shapes for Q, K, V matrices and output tensors during the forward pass in multi-head self-attention.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of rotary embeddings applied to query (Q) and key (K). It is used when applying positional information through rotation within attention mechanisms, affecting tensor shapes for QKV projections during forward passes in Transformer layers with rotary embedding.",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The sequence length of the input data. This parameter determines the size and shape of tensors passed to `fwd_kvcache` function, impacting attention calculations over a specific context window or sequence length.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of sequences in one batch during training/inference; it affects tensor shapes for input data (x) as well as output dimensions from the model's forward pass. It is used to determine cache sizes and manage parallel processing across multiple GPUs or devices.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Scaling factor applied before computing softmax in attention mechanism, affecting tensor shapes for QK^T matrix multiplication during the computation of scaled dot-product attention. It is used to normalize scores and improve numerical stability."
