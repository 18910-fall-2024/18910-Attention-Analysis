{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings in Transformer models.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used for multi-head self-attention mechanism. It determines how many parallel attention processes will be run over the same data, each with a different linear projection and output weight matrix.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality (i.e., size) of each head in multi-headed self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. It is calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` where embed_dim refers to the total embedding dimensions for all heads combined.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension used by rotary position embeddings, which are a type of positional encoding that can be added directly into attention queries and keys. It is typically half or quarter of head_dim depending on the interleaved setting.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The sequence length (number of tokens) in a batch for Transformer models during training and inference. It is used to determine how many positions each token can attend to based on the attention mechanism's configuration.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The number of sequences (or samples) processed in parallel within a batch during training and inference. It is crucial for managing memory usage efficiently when dealing with large datasets or long sequence lengths.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A scaling factor applied to the dot product of query-key pairs before computing attention scores. It helps stabilize gradients during training and is often set as `1 / sqrt(head_dim)`.",
    "causal": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A boolean flag indicating whether the model should use causal (or masked) attention, meaning that each token can only attend to previous tokens. This is typically used in autoregressive models like language generation tasks.",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A tuple specifying the left and right window size for local attention, which restricts each token to attend only within a sliding window of tokens. This is useful in models like BERT where full context might not be necessary.",
    "rotary_interleaved": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A boolean flag indicating whether rotary position embeddings should apply interleaving, which combines dimensions differently compared to non-interleaved settings. This affects how positional information is encoded into the attention mechanism.",
    "cache_seqlens": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.forward, flash_atn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] An integer or tensor indicating sequence lengths of cached keys and values used for incremental decoding in Transformer models. It helps manage memory efficiently by reusing previously computed attention outputs.",
    "cache_batch_idx": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.forward, flash_atn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] An integer or tensor indicating batch indices to use when indexing into the cached keys and values during incremental decoding. It ensures correct retrieval of cache entries for each sequence in a batch."
