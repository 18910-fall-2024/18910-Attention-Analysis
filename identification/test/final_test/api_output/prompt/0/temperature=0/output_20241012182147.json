{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings for each token in a sequence.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by the multi-head self-attention mechanism. This parameter determines how many parallel attention mechanisms are applied to different parts (or 'heads') of the input embeddings, and it is a key factor in determining model capacity.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each head's output from the multi-head self-attention mechanism. It is calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` where embed_dim refers to the total embedding dimensions for all heads combined.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of rotary embeddings applied during attention computation which helps in capturing relative positions between tokens. This parameter is crucial when using techniques like RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding).",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The sequence length of the input tokens. This parameter is essential for determining how many positions in a sequence are considered during attention computation.",

    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] Scaling factor applied to QK^T before applying softmax. This parameter is crucial for stabilizing attention scores during computation.",
    "window_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Defines the left and right context window size in local (sliding) attention mechanism which restricts each query to attend only within a certain range of keys. This parameter is important for controlling computational efficiency when dealing with long sequences.",
    "num_splits": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Number of splits along the sequence dimension used in key and value tensors during attention computation, which can affect performance optimization."
