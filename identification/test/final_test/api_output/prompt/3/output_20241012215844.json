{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the model's hidden states.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads in each Transformer layer. This hyperparameter is crucial for determining how information flows within and between layers during training or inference with Transformers.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality (size) of the key, query, value projections per head. It's calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` in MHA class initialization.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The dimensionality of the rotary embedding applied to queries and keys, which is used for positional encoding. It's crucial for models that rely on relative position embeddings.",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The sequence length of the input tensor `q`. This hyperparameter is essential in determining how long sequences are processed during attention mechanism operations.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Scaling factor for QK^T before applying softmax. It's used to normalize the dot product of query and key vectors, which is crucial in determining attention scores.",
    "causal": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Boolean indicating whether causal masking should be applied during self-attention. This parameter determines if the model can only attend to previous positions, which is typical in autoregressive models.",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Tuple indicating left and right window size for local attention. This hyperparameter restricts the model's ability to attend only within a sliding window, which is useful in models with limited context.",
    "rotary_interleaved": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Boolean indicating whether rotary embeddings are interleaved. This parameter affects how the positional encoding dimensions are combined and applied to queries and keys."
