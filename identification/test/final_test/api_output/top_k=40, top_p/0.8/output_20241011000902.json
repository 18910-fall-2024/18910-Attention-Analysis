{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings or hidden states in a Transformer model.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. This parameter determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to the input embeddings or hidden states in a Transformer model.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each head's output, calculated as `embed_dim // num_heads` where `embed_dim` is the total embedding size and `num_heads` is the number of attention heads. This parameter determines how much information (dimension-wise) can be processed by a single attention mechanism.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality used for rotary position embeddings, which are applied to queries and keys in self-attention mechanisms before computing the dot product. This parameter determines how much positional information is encoded into each head's output through rotation-based techniques.",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The sequence length of input sequences, which affects the size and shape of tensors passed to `fwd_kvcache` in terms of their temporal dimension. This parameter is crucial for determining how much context (sequence history) each token has access to during attention computation.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] The number of sequences processed simultaneously, which affects the batch size dimensions of tensors passed through `fwd_kvcache`. It determines the parallelism level in terms of sequence processing within a single forward pass or inference step.",
    "max_seqlen": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The maximum possible length of sequences that can be handled by KV cache, which is used to pre-allocate memory for caching keys and values during incremental decoding. This parameter ensures sufficient storage capacity in the cache mechanism.",
    "cache_seqlens": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The sequence lengths stored within each batch's cached sequences, indicating how many tokens have been processed so far by a given model instance when using KV caching for incremental decoding. This parameter is crucial for correctly indexing and updating the cache.",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A tuple specifying the left and right context window sizes used in local attention mechanisms, which restricts each query to attend only within a sliding window around its position. This parameter controls how much contextual information is considered for each token during self-attention computations.",
    "rotary_interleaved": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A boolean indicating whether rotary embeddings are interleaved across even and odd dimensions or applied in a GPT-NeoX style. This parameter affects how positional information is encoded into queries and keys through rotation-based techniques."
