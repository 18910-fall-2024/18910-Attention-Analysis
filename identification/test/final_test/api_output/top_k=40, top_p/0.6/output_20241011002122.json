{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the embedding or hidden layer in a Transformer model.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. It determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to different subspaces of the input data, and it is a key hyperparameter in Transformer models.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each head within multi-head attention (MHA). This parameter defines the size of individual heads when splitting up the embedding or hidden layer into multiple parallel self-attention mechanisms. It is derived from `embed_dim` and `num_heads`, where `head_dim = embed_dim // num_heads`. In other words, it represents how much information each head can process.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the rotary positional embedding used in self-attention mechanisms. This hyperparameter is crucial for models that use Rotary Positional Embeddings to inject position-awareness into attention computations without increasing computational complexity, as it determines how much information about positions can be encoded.",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The sequence length of the input data. This parameter is critical for determining the size and shape of tensors passed to attention mechanisms like FlashAttention, especially when dealing with cache management during inference or generation tasks.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of sequences processed in parallel within a batch. It influences how many independent instances are handled simultaneously by each layer's operations including self-attention and feed-forward networks.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] Scaling factor applied to the dot product of query-key pairs before computing softmax in attention mechanisms. This hyperparameter is crucial for stabilizing gradients and improving numerical stability during training.",
    "causal": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] Boolean flag indicating whether the model should enforce a causal mask on self-attention. This parameter determines if attention mechanisms allow tokens to attend only to previous positions in sequence data (useful for autoregressive models like language modeling).",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Tuple defining the left and right window size for local self-attention. This hyperparameter is used when implementing sliding-window attention mechanisms, allowing tokens to attend only within a specific range of positions relative to their own position.",
    "rotary_interleaved": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Boolean flag indicating whether rotary embeddings are interleaved across dimensions. This parameter affects how positional information is encoded into the attention mechanism, particularly in models like GPT-NeoX where specific patterns of dimension pairing enhance performance.",
    "cache_seqlens": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Tensor indicating sequence lengths for each batch element within cached sequences. This hyperparameter helps manage and update key-value caches efficiently during incremental decoding or generation tasks, ensuring that the correct segments are updated as new tokens are processed."
