{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings for each token in a sequence.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by the Transformer model. This hyperparameter determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to different parts (or 'heads') of the input embeddings, allowing for more complex relationships between tokens.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each attention head in multi-head attention mechanism. It is calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` and determines how much information can be processed by a single attention head.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the rotary positional embedding used in each token's representation. This hyperparameter is crucial for models that use Rotary Positional Embeddings to incorporate position information into self-attention.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The length of the sequence (number of tokens) in a batch. This hyperparameter determines how long each input sequence is and affects memory requirements for attention mechanisms.",
    "batch_size": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.allocate_inference_cache, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of sequences processed simultaneously by the model during training or inference. It impacts parallelism in batch processing but does not directly affect the size/dimensionality of tensors input to `fwd_kvcache`.",
    "max_seqlen": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The maximum sequence length that can be handled by the KV cache. This hyperparameter is used for pre-allocation and management of memory during inference, especially in scenarios like incremental decoding or generation tasks."
