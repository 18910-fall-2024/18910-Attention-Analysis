{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embedding or hidden state in a Transformer model.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. It determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to the input embeddings or hidden states in a Transformer model.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each head within multi-head attention, calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` where embed_dim is typically referred to as dim. It specifies how wide (dimension-wise) the individual heads are in a MHA mechanism.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of rotary embeddings used for positional encoding, which can be interleaved or not depending on `rotary_interleaved`. This parameter is crucial when using Rotary Position Embeddings to enhance the attention mechanism in Transformers by providing sinusoidal position information.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] The sequence length of input data. It determines how long each sample's time or token sequence will be, which affects memory and computation requirements for models like transformers that process sequences.",
    "world_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of processes in the distributed setup used to parallelize model training across multiple GPUs/CPUs. This parameter is essential when setting up data/model parallelism strategies during multi-GPU or multi-node training scenarios.",
    "batch_size": "[flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] The number of samples processed in a single forward/backward pass through the model. It is crucial for determining memory and computational requirements during both inference and training phases."
