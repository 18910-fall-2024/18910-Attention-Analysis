{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings for each token in a sequence.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. It determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to different subspaces of the input embeddings, and it is a key hyperparameter for controlling model capacity.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each attention head within MHA layers; calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` in Transformer models. It affects how much information can be processed by individual heads and is crucial for balancing computational efficiency with model expressiveness.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the rotary positional embedding used to encode relative positions between tokens, enhancing attention mechanisms' ability to capture long-range dependencies. It must be divisible by 16 if interleaved mode is enabled and should not exceed half of `head_dim`.",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The sequence length for the current batch, which determines how many tokens are processed in a single forward pass. It influences both memory requirements and computational complexity during training or inference with Transformers.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of sequences (or samples) being processed simultaneously by the model; it affects parallelism and can influence batch normalization statistics if used within layers."
