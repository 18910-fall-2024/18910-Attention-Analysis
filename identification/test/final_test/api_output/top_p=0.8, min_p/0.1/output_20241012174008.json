{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the embedding or hidden state in Transformer models.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. It determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to different subspaces of the input data, and it is a key hyperparameter that affects both model capacity and computational efficiency.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each attention head in MHA. It's calculated as `embed_dim / num_heads` where embed_dim is the total embedding or hidden state size, and it influences how much information can be processed by a single self-attention mechanism.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of rotary embeddings used in attention mechanisms. It affects the positional encoding applied to queries (Q) and keys (K), enhancing model performance on tasks requiring understanding of relative positions between tokens, especially for long sequences.",
    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The sequence length or the number of input elements in a batch. It is crucial as it determines how many time steps are considered during attention computation and impacts memory requirements for storing activations.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The size or the number of sequences processed in a single batch. It affects parallelism and computational efficiency; larger batches can lead to better utilization but may also increase memory requirements.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The scaling factor applied before computing the softmax in attention mechanisms. It is used for numerical stability and typically set as `1 / sqrt(head_dim)`, where head_dim refers to the dimension of each individual attention head.",
    "window_size": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A tuple representing (left, right), determining how far left and right a token can attend in local self-attention mechanisms. It is crucial for models that need to limit the context window size.",
    "rotary_interleaved": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] A boolean indicating whether rotary embeddings are interleaved or not, affecting how positional information is applied in attention mechanisms. It influences model performance on tasks requiring understanding of relative positions between tokens."
