{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings for each token in a sequence.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by the multi-head self-attention mechanism. This hyperparameter determines how many parallel attention mechanisms are applied to different parts (or 'heads') of the input embeddings, and it is crucial for determining both the shape of QKV matrices as well as output dimensions.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each head in multi-head self-attention. This hyperparameter determines how many features are processed by individual attention heads within a single transformer layer, and it is derived from the total embedding size divided evenly among all heads.",
    "rotary_emb_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of rotary embeddings used for positional encoding in multi-head self-attention. This hyperparameter influences how much information about token positions can be encoded within each head's attention mechanism, affecting the model¡¯s ability to capture long-range dependencies.",
    "seqlen": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA._apply_rotary_update_kvcache_attention] The sequence length of input tokens for which multi-head self-attention is being computed. This hyperparameter determines how many time steps or positions are considered in the attention mechanism, impacting both memory requirements and computational complexity.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of sequences processed simultaneously during training/inference. It affects parallelism efficiency but also resource consumption such as GPU VRAM usage."
