{
    "dim": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimension of the input embeddings or hidden states in a Transformer model.",
    "num_heads": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__, tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel] Number of attention heads used by Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. It is an important hyperparameter that determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied to the input embeddings or hidden states.",
    "head_dim": "[flash_attn.modules.mha.MHA.__init__] The dimensionality of each head in multi-head attention, calculated as `embed_dim // num_heads` where embed_dim is the total embedding size and num_heads is the number of heads. It determines how much information can be processed by a single self-attention mechanism.",

    "seqlen": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] Sequence length of input sequences. It determines how many time steps are processed at once by a Transformer layer and is crucial for defining the context window size in self-attention mechanisms.",
    "batch_size": "[tests.modules.test_block_parallel.test_block_parallel, flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_with_kvcache] The number of input sequences or samples being processed simultaneously. It affects how many parallel computations can be done across different batches during training and inference."
