==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON object containing the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "qkv_shape": "(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
  "dropout_p": "float. Dropout probability.",
  "softmax_scale": "None or float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.",
  "causal": "bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "(left, right) If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "(nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j."
}
```

Here's a brief description for each parameter:

- **qkv_shape**: The shape of input tensor `qkv` in function `_flash_attn_forward`, which determines the sizes, dimensions, or shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
- **dropout_p**: A hyperparameter used in functions like `attention_pytorch` and `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`, determining dropout probability for training with attention mechanism.
- **softmax_scale**: The scaling factor applied before softmax operation. It's a hyperparameter used in function `_flash_attn_forward`, which determines the input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
- **causal**: A boolean flag indicating whether causal mask should be applied during forward pass, as seen in functions like `attention_pytorch` and `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`. It's a hyperparameter used for training or inference with attention mechanism.
- **window_size**: The size of the sliding window local attention. This is another hyperparameter that determines input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
- **alibi_slopes**: A bias term added during forward pass, which can be seen in function `_flash_attn_forward`. It's a hyperparameter used for training with attention mechanism.

Note: The description of each parameter includes both the function where it is used and its role or purpose.
