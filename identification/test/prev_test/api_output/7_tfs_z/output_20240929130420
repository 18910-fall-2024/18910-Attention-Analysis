==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input sequences, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length for input sequences, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, calculated as dim // headdim in benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b -> time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply",
  "headdim": "The dimension per head for the input sequence, used to calculate nheads and flops.",
  "dim": "The total dimension of each attention head in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "causal": "A boolean indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "A tuple specifying the window size for local attention, used to implement sliding window local attention in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "alibi_slopes": "The slopes of alibi bias added to the attention score, calculated as (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) and used in _flash_attn_forward",
  "dropout_p": "A float indicating dropout probability for input sequences in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied before softmax operation in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func."
}
```

Note that I have only included the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and ignored boolean parameters used solely as return formats of functions.
