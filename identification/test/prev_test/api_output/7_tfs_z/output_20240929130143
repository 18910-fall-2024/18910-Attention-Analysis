==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length for input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, calculated as dim // headdim in time_f_bwd function.",
  "headdim": "The dimension per head, used to calculate nheads. Also affects the size of input tensors q, k, v",
  "dim": "Total model dimension, used to calculate nheads and also impacts attention mechanism's structure.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for training mode in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied before softmax operation. Defaults to sqrt(headdim) if not provided",
  "causal": "Whether causal mask should be used during attention computation, impacts the structure of attention mechanism",
  "window_size": "(left, right). If set, implements sliding window local attention in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function.",
