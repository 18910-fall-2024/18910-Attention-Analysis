==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input sequences, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length for input sequences, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, calculated as dim // headdim in benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b -> time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply",
  "headdim": "The dimension per head for input sequences, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "dim": "The total model dimension (2048) used to calculate nheads = dim // headdim in benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b -> time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism, set to 0.0 during evaluation and used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax, calculated as headdim ^ (-0.5) or set manually in _flash_attn_forward",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "The size of the sliding window local attention (left, right), used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward",
  "alibi_slopes": "A bias for alibi slopes to be added to attention scores, calculated as a list or tensor based on input arguments in _flash_attn_forward.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of backward pass, used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply",
  "return_softmax": "A boolean flag indicating whether to return softmax probabilities during forward pass, set manually in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward"
}
```

Note that I have ignored the `repeats` hyperparameter as it's not directly related to attention mechanism or tensor sizes.
