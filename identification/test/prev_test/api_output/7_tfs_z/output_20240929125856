Here is a list of **all** hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The number of sequences in the input batch. Used as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "seqlen": "The length of each sequence in the input batch. Used as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads used by the model. Calculated from headdim (2048) / headdim (64 or 128).",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the multi-head attention mechanism. Used to calculate nheads and as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether causal masking should be applied during self-attention computation. Used as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, _flash_attn_forward, and _flash_attn_backward.",
    "window_size": "The size of the sliding window used in local attention (if applicable). If (-1,-1), no local attention is performed. Used as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A bias added to the attention scores based on the absolute difference between query and key indices. Used as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, _flash_attn_forward, and _flash_attn_backward.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used during self-attention computation. Used as an argument for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, _flash_attn_forward, and _flash_attn_backward."
