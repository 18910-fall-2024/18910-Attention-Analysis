==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of input data. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, _flash_attn_forward",
    "seqlen": "Sequence length. Used in time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "nheads": "Number of attention heads for multi-head attention mechanism in the Transformer model. Derived from dim / headdim in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head, used to calculate nheads (number of attention heads). Used in time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "causal": "Whether causal mask is applied during self-attention. Used in time_fwd_bwd, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, _flash_attn_forward",
    "window_size": "Context window size for local sliding attention. Default to (-1,-1), which means infinite context window. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "dropout_p": "Probability of dropout during self-attention computation. Set to 0.0 by default, used in time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization. If None, set it as the inverse square root of headdim (dimensionality per head). Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward"
}
```

These hyperparameters determine sizes or shapes of input tensors to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

- "batch_size" determines batch size,
- "seqlen" determines sequence length
- "nheads", "headdim" together calculate the shape for attention mechanism in each head.
- The rest are used as masks, biases or probabilities during computing self-attention
