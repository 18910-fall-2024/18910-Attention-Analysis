==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` extracted from the code snippets:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensors. It's used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length of input tensor. It's used in flops, time_fwd_bwd, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "headdim": "The head dimension (i.e., the hidden size per attention head). It's used in flops, time_fwd_bwd, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads. It's calculated as dim // headdim in benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask or not. It's used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "window_size": "The size of sliding window for local attention. It's optional and used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A bias added to the attention score based on absolute difference between query position and key position. It's optional and used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward."
}
```

These **hyperparameters** are all related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` because they determine either the sizes/dimensions/shapes of input tensors or attention model structures in `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
