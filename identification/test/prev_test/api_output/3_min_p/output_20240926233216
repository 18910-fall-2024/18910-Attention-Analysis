==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON object containing the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, calculated as dim // headdim in time_f_bwd function.",
  "headdim": "The dimension of each head, used to calculate nheads and flops in time_f_bwd function.",
  "causal": "A boolean indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "A tuple (left, right) specifying the size of sliding window local attention, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "alibi_slopes": "The slopes for alibi bias, used to calculate a bias term added to attention scores in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_backward.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor for softmax normalization, calculated as headdim ** (-0.5) or set to None if not specified in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func."
}
```

Note that I ignored the boolean hyperparameters `deterministic` and `return_softmax`, which do nothing with the attention mechanism but only decide return format of a function.
