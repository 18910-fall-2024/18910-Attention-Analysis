==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "qkv_shape": "(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
  "dropout_p": "float. Dropout probability.",
  "softmax_scale": "float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.",
  "causal": "bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "(left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "fp32. A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j."
}
```

Here's a brief description for each parameter:

- **qkv_shape**: This hyperparameter determines the shape of input tensors Q, K, V in `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` (and hence related functions like `_flash_attn_forward`). It is used to initialize attention weights and biases.

- **dropout_p**: In `attention_pytorch`, this parameter controls dropout probability for output attentions. This hyperparameter affects the training process of Transformers by randomly dropping out units during forward passes, preventing overfitting.

- **softmax_scale**: The softmax scale determines how QK^T is scaled before applying softmax in attention calculations within `_flash_attn_forward` and `attention_pytorch`. It influences the output attentions' distribution shapes.

- **causal**: This boolean parameter applies causal masks to attention weights when set True. In Transformers, this mask prevents a model from attending to future tokens during inference or training with auto-regressive modeling in mind.

- **window_size**: When not (-1, -1), `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` implements sliding window local attention by restricting query attentions within specified left and right offsets of the current token. This hyperparameter affects how context is aggregated for each input sequence position during inference or training with Transformers that use this mechanism.

- **alibi_slopes**: In `_flash_attn_forward`, `FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply` uses alibi slopes to add a bias term (-slope * |i - j|) to attention scores between query i and key j. This hyperparameter influences how attentions are calculated for each input sequence position during inference or training with Transformers that use this mechanism.

Note: The descriptions provided focus on the roles of these parameters within `flash_attn_2_cuda` and related functions, emphasizing their impact on Transformer models' behavior in terms of attention mechanisms and output distributions.
