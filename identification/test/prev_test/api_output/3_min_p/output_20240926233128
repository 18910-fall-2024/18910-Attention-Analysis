==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON output of the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). The input qkv should be in this format for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to work correctly.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. Should be set to 0.0 during evaluation",
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. Default is sqrt(headdim)",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling). Default is False.",
  "window_size": "(left, right) If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention",
  "alibi_slopes": "A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j. Can be a tensor or scalar.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return the softmax probabilities (for testing only)",
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input qkv. Used in flops calculation",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length for input qkv. Used in flops calculation",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads. Calculated from headdim and dim",
  "headdim": "Head dimension for each head. Also used as the scaling factor for softmax"
}
```

Note that I have only included hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` in this output, which are:

* qkv
* dropout_p
* softmax_scale
* causal
* window_size
* alibi_slopes
* deterministic
* return_softmax

I also added batch_size and seqlen as they were used in the flops calculation.
