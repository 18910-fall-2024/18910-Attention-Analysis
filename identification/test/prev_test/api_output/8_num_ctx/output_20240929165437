Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor shape, a 5D tensor of size (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for QK^T before applying softmax",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask",
    "window_size": "(left, right) tuple representing the size of sliding window local attention",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes for alibi attention mechanism",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass in flash_attn_2_cuda"
}
```

Note that `qkv` is a hyperparameter because it determines the input tensor shape and size, which affects how the attention model processes inputs. The other parameters are all related to specific components or mechanisms within `flash_attn_2_cuda`, such as dropout probability (`dropout_p`) for regularization during training, scaling factor (`softmax_scale`) for normalization of QK^T scores in softmax calculation, causal mask application flag (`causal`), and so on.

Here's a brief explanation of each parameter:

*   **qkv**: The input tensor shape is crucial because it determines the size of attention heads, batch size, sequence length, number of queries (Q) keys(K), values(V). It also affects how `flash_attn_2_cuda` processes inputs.
*   **dropout_p**: This hyperparameter controls regularization during training. A dropout rate greater than 0 means that some neurons will be randomly dropped out in each forward pass to prevent overfitting, which can help improve generalization and robustness of the model.

The rest are related to specific components or mechanisms within `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
