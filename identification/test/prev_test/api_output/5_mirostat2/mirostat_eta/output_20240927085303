==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **all** hyperparameters that are related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, especially for those determining the input tensors' sizes, dimensions and shapes:

```
{
    "qkv_shape": "The shape of QKV tensor input into flash_attn interface. Determined by batch_size, seqlen (sequence length), 3 (for query/key/value split) nheads, head_dim.",
    "batch_size": "Batch size for attention mechanism in the Transformer model.",
    "seqlen": "Sequence length for attention mechanism in the Transformer model.",
    "nheads": "Number of attention heads used in each transformer layer.",
    ¡°window_size¡±:"Size of window for local sliding window attention.
",
	"alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes to be added to attention scores based on position difference between query and key."
}
```
These hyperparameters are all related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` by being used in the calculation process, especially those determining input tensor sizes or shapes.
