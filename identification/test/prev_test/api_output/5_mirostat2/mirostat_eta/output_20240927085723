==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **all** related hyperparameters used for training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers:

```python
{
    "batch_size": "The number of sequences in the batch. Used to determine the input tensor size.",
    "seqlen": "Sequence length. Input sequence lengths must match up",
    "headdim": "Size of each head (dimension). Determines attention model structure inside flash\_attn2\_cuda function",
    "nheads": "Number of heads for multi-head self-attention. Affects number of elements in input tensor to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.",
    "causal": "Whether causal mask should be applied during forward pass. Used for training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers.",
    "window_size": "Sliding window sizes used for local attention (if applicable). Determines the size of context windows and hence input tensor to `flash_attn_2_cuda`"
}
```
