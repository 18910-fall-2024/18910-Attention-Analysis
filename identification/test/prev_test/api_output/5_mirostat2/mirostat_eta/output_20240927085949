==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a dictionary of hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` with their descriptions:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The size of the batch in flash attention forward computation, used in _flash_attn_forward and FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.",
    "seq_len": "The length of the sequence in flash attention forward computation, not explicitly defined but implied from code snippets related to qkv tensor dimensions (3D: seq length * nheads).",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads used for parallelization and memory efficiency. Defined implicitly as dim / headdim.",
    "headdim": "The dimension per head in flash attention forward computation, which is the reciprocal relationship with 'dim' (2048) to compute 'nheads'.",
    "dropout_p": "Probability at dropping-out values during training phase for regularization and preventing overfitting. Defined as 0.0 or other float value.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied before softmax function, which can be a fixed scale defaulting from headdim square root; otherwise it must be explicitly provided by user input.",
    "causal": "Boolean parameter determines whether causal attention mask is needed for auto-regressive modeling. If True in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func (not defined here) or elsewhere possibly means skipping the masking process.",
    "window_size": "(left, right) size of sliding window local attentions used if not infinite context (`-1,-1`). Defined as (-1,-1), implying no locality restriction but can be set differently in user calls to flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias (slope) applied based on row and column indices during soft attention computation. Defaults to None, meaning no slope is added.",
    "deterministic": "Boolean flag decide whether use the deterministic variant of backward pass in _flash_attn_backward. If False implies otherwise True with a slightly slower speed",
}
