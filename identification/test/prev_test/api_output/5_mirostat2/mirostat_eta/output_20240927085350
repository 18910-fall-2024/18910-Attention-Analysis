Here is a JSON object containing the list of hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, along with their descriptions:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The size of each batch in the input tensor qkv, used as an argument for functions such as flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The length of each sequence in the input tensor qkv, used as an argument for functions such as flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the Transformer model, calculated by dividing the dimension dim into headdim to determine the size of diagonal QKV tensors passed through flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head, used as an argument for functions such as flops and _flash_attn_forward. It affects the computation cost indirectly via nheads.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask in transformer models with autoregressive properties",
  "softwmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function applied within flash_attn_2_cuda for handling dot products of Q and K tensors ( scaling out inputs when multiplying)",
  "window_size": "(left, right) - tuple indicating context window size used by local attention component in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc",
  "alibi_slopes": "-used inside _flash_attn_forward to introduce biases depending on position difference of query and key for handling alibi-loss"
}
