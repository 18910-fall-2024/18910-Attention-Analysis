==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON object that contains the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "Input batch size, typically set as an argument when calling flash_attn_qkvpacked_func or attention_pytorch.",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length of input tensor. Typically used in conjunction with batch_size for calculating sequence_parallel-related hyperparameters such as window_size and alibi_slopes.",
  "nheads": "Number of self-attention heads, determined by model dimension (dim) divided into head_dim. Defaults to dim // headdim when qkv is packed into one tensor via flash_attn_qkvpacked_func or attention_pytorch.",
  "headdim": "Dimension per self-attention head in case batch_size and seqlen are not set together with nheads, allows flexibility over traditional QKV split (batch_size, seqlen, headdims)",
}
```

Additionally I identify `dim` which determines the size of attention heads but it's actually a parameter used for computing `nheels`.

I did ignore boolean hyperparameters like `causal`, and also parameters that do not relate to tensor sizes or dimensions as requested.
