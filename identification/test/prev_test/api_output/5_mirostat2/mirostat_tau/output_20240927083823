Here is a list of **all** hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor in attention calculation",
  "dropout_p": "Probability for dropout during training, set to 0.0 when evaluating or inference.",
  "window_size": "Tuple representing the size of sliding window local attention (or infinite context if (-1, -1))",
   "alibi_slopes": "Bias values in alibi attention model used in flash_attn_2_cuda (tensor with shape=(nheads,) or batch-wise)",
     "batch_size": "Batch size input to `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` and then directly passed down to `_flash_attn_forward`, later leading to hyperparameter for `flash_attn_2_cuda`,
      seqlen":"Sequence length in the data inputted into function wrapped by `flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply() - mainly, before being called upon by `_flash_atnn_forward` and finally reach variable within
        headdim": "The head dimension for QKV attention, set to 64 or 128 in the given model",
         "nheads": "Number of attention heads used during computation where `seqlen` is defined beforehand,
          causal=True":"Boolean enabling implementation of causal masking on inputted data. True when using auto-regressive modeling methods.,
           rng_state ":"random number generator state, which just passed down in the call chain",
            dtype":The type of tensor used for computing attention multiple times through function calls within codebase
}
```
Please note that some hyperparameters such as `batch_size`, `seqlen` and `headdim` may look same but they have varied dimensionality throughout their usecases depending on where they were first called. I've maintained this way to honour the context of original text while keeping in mind that these parameters indeed share similar naming yet form various shapes/dimensionality based upon what was applied previously.

Assuming you'd want strictly interpret or treat them as used finally before becoming an argument at `flash_attn_2_cuda`, then the code snippets might reduce down hyperparameters from their multiple dimensional attributes specifically leading to ¡°batch_size¡± =32, seqlen=512  etc.
