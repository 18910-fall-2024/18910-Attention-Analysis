==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON output with the identified hyperparameters and their respective descriptions:

```
{
  "qkv_shape": "Input tensor shape (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, head_dim) for flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "dropout_p": "(float, optional): dropout probability during training. Default value is -1 indicating using default configurations.",
  "window_size": "sliding window size for local attention in flash_attn_2_cuda (default to (-1,-1))",
  "softmax_scale": ": scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. The default will be sqrt(head_dim)",
  "nheads": "(int): number of multi-heads used by the Transformer model, here it determines how many attention mechanism are run concurrently and in parallel.",
  "headdim": "(int): head dimension (channel) for each individual transformer block or layer"
}
```

Please note that I omitted causal as per your instruction to ignore boolean hyperparameters. Also, keep in mind that you will need the full provided code snippet with all functions calling `flash_attn_2_cuda` to identify other potential hyperparameters.

Hope this helps!
