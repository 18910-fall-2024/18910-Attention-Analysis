==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length of input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the Transformer model, calculated as dim // headdim",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the Transformer model, used to calculate nheads",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied (default: True)",
    "window_size": "A tuple specifying the left and right context window sizes for sliding window local attention (default: (-1, -1))",
    "alibi_slopes": "An array of slopes to add as bias in the alibi mechanism (optional)"
}
```

Note that `dropout_p`, `softmax_scale` are not included because they do not determine the size or shape of input tensors.
