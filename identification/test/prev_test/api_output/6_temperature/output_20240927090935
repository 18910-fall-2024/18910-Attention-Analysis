==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the extracted hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input tensors, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length for input tensors, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, calculated as dim // headdim in time_fwd_bwd function.",
  "headdim": "The dimension per head for the QKV tensor, used to calculate nheads in time_fwd_bwd function.",
  "causal": "A boolean indicating whether to apply causal attention mask, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "A tuple of left and right window sizes for sliding window local attention, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "alibi_slopes": "The slopes for alibi bias, calculated as (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads) in time_fwd_bwd function."
}
```

Note that I ignored the boolean hyperparameters like `deterministic` which only decide return format of a function but do nothing with attention mechanism.
