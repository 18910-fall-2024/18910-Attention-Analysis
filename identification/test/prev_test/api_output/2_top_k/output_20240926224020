```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input data for attention mechanism, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of input data for attention mechanism, used in time_fwd_bwd and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads in Transformer model, calculated as dim // headdim in flops function.",
  "headdim": "The head dimension of attention weights in Transformer model, used to calculate the total FLOPs for forward/backward pass and efficiency of different methods.",
  "causal": "A boolean hyperparameter indicating whether causal mask should be applied during attention mechanism, affects both training and inference with attention mechanism",
  "dropout_p": "The probability of dropout applied after computing attention weights in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, determines how much information will be dropped for regularization purposes.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor used to normalize the output of QK^T before applying softmax function during forward pass, affects training and inference with attention mechanism",
  "window_size": "The size of sliding window local attention in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, determines how much context will be attended for each query.",
