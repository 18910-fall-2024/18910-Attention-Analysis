==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensor, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length of input tensor, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward. It determines the output shape of out (or Q * K^T) for flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads per layer. Used to determine the number of channels for each head in q, k, v",
  "headdim": "Dimensionality of a single attention head. It determines the size and shape of out (or Q * K^T) for flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal mask on key values (K). Used in _flash_attn_forward",
  "window_size": "(left, right), If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Determines the size and shape of input tensor out for flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "alibi_slopes": "A bias to be added to the attention score based on the distance between query (i) and key positions. Used in _flash_atnn_forward",
  "dropout_p": "The probability of dropout used during training, determines whether gradients are zeroed out for some output elements in flash_attn_2_cuda"
}
```

Note: These hyperparameters determine the sizes, dimensions or shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, such as q (query), k (key) and v (value).
