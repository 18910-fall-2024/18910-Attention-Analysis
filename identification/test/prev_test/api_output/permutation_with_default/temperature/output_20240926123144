==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The number of batches in a tensor input to flash_attn_2_cuda. It determines the size of the first dimension of the output.",
    "seqlen": "The length of sequences in a tensor input to flash_attn_2_cuda. It determines the size of the second dimension of the output.",
    "headdim": "The dimension of each head in a tensor input to flash_attn_2_cuda. It determines the size of the fourth dimension of the output.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads in flash_attn_2_cuda. It determines the size of the third dimension of the output and affects the structure of the attention model.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used in flash_attn_2_cuda for training, which helps to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out elements from the input tensor.",
    "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor used in the softmax function applied to the output of flash_attn_2_cuda. It affects the magnitude and shape of the output attention weights.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply a causal mask to the attention mechanism in flash_attn_2_cuda, which is typically used for auto-regressive modeling and prevents an element from attending to any position after it.",
    "window_size": "The window size used in local attention implemented by flash_attn_2_cuda. It affects the range of positions that an element can attend to and determines the shape of the output attention weights.",
    "alibi_slopes": "The alibi slopes used to compute a bias term added to the attention scores computed by flash_attn_2_cuda, which can help improve the stability of the training process."
