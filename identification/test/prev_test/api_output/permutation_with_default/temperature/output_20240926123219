Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "Input tensor batch size, typically set by the user for training or inference",
    "seqlen": "Length of input sequence tensor in each mini-batch, which determines the attention span for each query.",
    "headdim": "Dimension and size of a head, which affects model parallelization",
    "nheads": "Number of heads used in multi-head attention mechanism",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling (e.g., language modeling)",
    "window_size": "(left, right) values used to implement sliding window local attention",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias added to attention score based on absolute difference between query and key positions.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability in the attention mechanism, affects output of model and computation during inference or training"
}
```
