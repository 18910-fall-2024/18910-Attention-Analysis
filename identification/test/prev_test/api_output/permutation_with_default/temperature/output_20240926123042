==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The number of batches in the input data, used as a size parameter for attention mechanism. It is used in the function _flash_attn_forward",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length of the input data, used as a size parameter for attention mechanism. It is used in the function _flash_attn_forward",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads, used to split the QKV into smaller chunks. It is calculated based on headdim and dim, used in the function time_f_bwd",
    "headdim": "The head dimension size, used as a dimension parameter for attention mechanism. It is used in the function flops",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to use causal attention mask. It is not directly related to tensor size or shape but affects the behavior of attention mechanism.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor used for softmax normalization, used as a dimension parameter for attention mechanism. It can be set manually in the function flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability, used as a hyperparameter for regularization during training. It is not directly related to tensor size or shape but affects the behavior of attention mechanism.",
    "window_size": "A tuple specifying the sliding window size for local attention, used as a dimension parameter for attention mechanism. It can be set manually in the function flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
    "alibi_slopes": "The alibi slopes used to add bias to attention scores, used as a dimension parameter for attention mechanism. It is not directly related to tensor size or shape but affects the behavior of attention mechanism."
}
```

Note that some hyperparameters are not explicitly set in this code snippet but have default values or are calculated internally, such as `nheads`.
