==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "Input tensor batch size, must be an integer.",
    "seqlen": "Sequence length of input tensors in `q`, `k`, and `v`, should be positive integers or scalars.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability in attention mechanism during forward pass, can also affect training procedure.",
    "nheads": "Number of attention heads in a multi-head self-attention transformer model architecture. The values are generated from qkv.shape[-2].",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling, typically set True when performing inference or testing on one example at a time.",
    "window_size": "Context window size for local sliding-window self-attention transformer model architecture, specifying window_size = (-1, -1) indicates the context size will be the entire sequence. Should have two elements (both non-negative integers) for specifying different sizes on both sides or use -1 if either is infinity.",
    "dim": "Input embedding dimension or feature vector size which should evenly divide into headdim without remainder."
}
```
Note that `alibi_slopes`, although used in the forward pass of `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`, is related to training a transformer and therefore considered as one not strictly involved during attention mechanism for Transformers inference, hence ignored by the specification.
