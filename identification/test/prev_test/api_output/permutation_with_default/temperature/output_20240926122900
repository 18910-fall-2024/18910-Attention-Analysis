==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). The input tensor qkv is used for attention mechanism in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and finally passed to flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. It's a hyperparameter used during training to prevent overfitting.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax. It determines the size of output tensors from flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and then passed to flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask. This is a boolean hyperparameter used in training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers.",
  "window_size": "(left, right) tuple. It's used to implement sliding window local attention. The size of input tensors from flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and then passed to flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes for alibi attention mechanism. This is a hyperparameter used in training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of the backward pass. This is a boolean hyperparameter that decides whether to return correct results from flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and then passed to flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return softmax probabilities from flash_attn_qkvpacked_func. This is a boolean hyperparameter used in testing, which determines the output shape of tensors from flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and then passed to flash_attn_2_cuda."
