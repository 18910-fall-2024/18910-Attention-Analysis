==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the identified hyperparameters:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). The input tensor qkv contains Q, K, V values for attention mechanism.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. Controls the amount of dropout applied to attention output.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization in attention mechanism.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "Sliding window size for local attention. If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes for alibi attention. A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass in attention mechanism.",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return attention probabilities. This option is for testing only.",
  "batch_size": "Batch size for input tensor qkv.",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length for input tensor qkv.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads in Transformer model.",
  "headdim": "Dimension of each attention head in Transformer model."
}
```

Note that I've only included the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and ignored boolean hyperparameters that don't affect the attention mechanism.
