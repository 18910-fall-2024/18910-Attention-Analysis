==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` that I was able to identify:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape, containing Q, K, and V values for attention mechanism in Transformers. Expected shape is (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim).",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor used in attention softmax function, default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling. Used in Transformer models.",
  "window_size": "Sliding window size for local attention, e.g., (left, right) for implementing sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes used in alibi method for attention scores, can be (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads).",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism, set to 0.0 during evaluation.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass for attention mechanism."
}
```
