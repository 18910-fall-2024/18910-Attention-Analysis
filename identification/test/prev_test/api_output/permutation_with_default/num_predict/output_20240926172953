Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` that I was able to identify:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape, containing Q, K, and V values for attention mechanism in Transformers. Expected shape is (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim).",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor used in attention softmax function, default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling. Used in Transformer models.",
  "window_size":
