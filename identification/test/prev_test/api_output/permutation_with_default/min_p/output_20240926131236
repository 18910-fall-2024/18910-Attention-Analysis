==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor of shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim) for attention mechanism in Transformers",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used during training or inference with attention mechanism in Transformers",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor used for softmax function in attention mechanism of Transformers",
    "causal": "Boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention mask in Transformers",
    "window_size": "Tuple of integers representing the left and right context window sizes for sliding window local attention in Transformers",
    "alibi_slopes": "List of slopes used as biases for attention scores in alibi attention mechanism of Transformers",
    "deterministic": "Boolean flag indicating whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass in attention mechanism of Transformers",
    "return_attn_probs": "Boolean flag indicating whether to return attention probabilities during testing in attention mechanism of Transformers"
