==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the identified hyperparameters:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). QKV packed input for flash attention.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. Used in training to prevent overfitting.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "Sliding window local attention parameters. If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory.",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for testing only.",
  "batch_size": "Batch size. Used in training or inference with attention mechanism.",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length. Used in training or inference with attention mechanism.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads. Used in Transformer architecture.",
  "headdim": "Dimension of each attention head. Used in Transformer architecture."
}
```

Note that I've only included the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and ignored the boolean hyperparameters that decide return format but do nothing with the attention mechanism.
