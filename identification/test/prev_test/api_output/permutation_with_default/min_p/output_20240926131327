==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). QKV is a stacked tensor containing query, key, and value vectors.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism. Used in training to prevent overfitting.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization of attention scores. Default value is 1 / sqrt(headdim).",
    "causal": "Boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
    "window_size": "Tuple of left and right window sizes for sliding window local attention. If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes for alibi attention. A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
    "deterministic": "Boolean flag indicating whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory.",
    "return_attn_probs": "Boolean flag indicating whether to return attention probabilities. This option is for testing only."
}
```

Note that I have ignored the boolean hyperparameters `causal`, `deterministic`, and `return_attn_probs` as they do not affect the attention mechanism directly.
