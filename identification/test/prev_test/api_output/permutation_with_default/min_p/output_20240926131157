==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor of shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim) for attention mechanism in Transformers",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism in Transformers, used during training to prevent overfitting",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function in attention mechanism, default is 1 / sqrt(headdim)",
    "causal": "Boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling) in attention mechanism",
    "window_size": "Tuple of two integers representing the left and right window size for sliding window local attention in attention mechanism",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias term for alibi slopes, used to add a bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) to the attention score of query i and key j",
    "deterministic": "Boolean flag indicating whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass in attention mechanism",
    "return_softmax": "Boolean flag indicating whether to return the attention probabilities in attention mechanism"
}
```

Note that `qkv` is not a hyperparameter itself, but rather the input tensor shape for the attention mechanism. However, I included it in the list as it is related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`. The other parameters are all hyperparameters used in the code snippets related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
