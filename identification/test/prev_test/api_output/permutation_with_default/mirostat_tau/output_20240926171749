Here is the list of hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size, which determines the number of sequences processed in parallel. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length, which determines the number of tokens in each input sequence. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, which determines the dimensionality of the attention mechanism. Used in flops and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "headdim": "The size of each attention head, which determines the number of features processed by each head. Used in flops and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling). Used in _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "The size of the sliding window, which determines the context window for local attention. Used in _flash_attn_forward.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability, which determines the fraction of features dropped during training. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor for the QK^T product, used to normalize the attention scores. Used in _flash_attn_forward."
