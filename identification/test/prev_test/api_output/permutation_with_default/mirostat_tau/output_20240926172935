Here is the JSON output of the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of the input tensor qkv.",
    "seqlen_vals": "A tuple containing seqlen values for testing different sequence lengths.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the Transformer model. Computed as dim // headdim, where dim is 2048 and headdim is set to various values (64, 128).",
    "headdim_vals": "A list containing two head dimension values for testing different head dimensions.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability when computing attention. Set to zero during evaluation.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether to apply causal attention mask or not. Used in auto-regressive modeling.",
