==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the list of hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv_shape": "Input tensor shape of (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim)",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization in attention calculation",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling",
  "window_size": "Window size for sliding window local attention",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes for alibi attention scores",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return attention probabilities"
}
```

Here's a brief description of each parameter:

- **qkv_shape**: This is the input tensor shape of `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`, which is `(batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim)`. It determines the dimensions and sizes of the tensors passed to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
  
- **dropout_p**: This hyperparameter controls the dropout probability for the attention mechanism in `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`. It affects the training and inference processes.

- **softmax_scale**: This parameter scales the QK^T matrix before softmax normalization. For transformers, it is usually set to 1 / sqrt(headdim), but here we can tune it anyway.

- **causal**: A boolean flag that determines whether to apply a causal attention mask in `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` for auto-regressive modeling.

- **window_size**: This parameter sets the window size for sliding window local attention in `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`. It controls how much context each position attends to.

- **alibi_slopes**: A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j. This can be used to modify the attention behavior, especially for transformers.

- **deterministic**: Whether `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` should use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass, which affects performance and memory usage during training.

- **return_softmax**: A flag that determines whether to return the attention probabilities in addition to the output.
