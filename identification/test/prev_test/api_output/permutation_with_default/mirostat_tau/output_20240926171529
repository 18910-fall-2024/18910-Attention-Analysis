==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with all the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The number of mini-batch samples in the input tensor, used for attention mechanism in flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length or size of the input tensor, used for attention mechanism in _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the Transformer model, used to split the input tensor into multiple smaller tensors.",
  "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the attention mechanism, used to compute the output of flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for feature importance masking, used during training and evaluation phases.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor for the attention softmax computation, used in attention_pytorch and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag to indicate whether causal attention mask should be applied.",
  "window_size": "The size of the sliding window local attention kernel, used to compute the output of flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply.",
  "alibi_slopes": "A list of slopes for alibi attention bias computation, used in _flash_attn_forward and attention_pytorch.",
  "deterministic": "A boolean flag to indicate whether deterministic implementation of the backward pass should be used.",
  "return_softmax": "A boolean flag to indicate whether softmax output should be returned."
}
```

These hyperparameters are all related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, which is used in `_flash_attn_forward` function. They determine the sizes, dimensions, and shapes of input tensors to `flash_attn_2_cuda` or affect the attention model structure used in `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
