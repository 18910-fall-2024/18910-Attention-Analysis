==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "the batch size of input data",
  "seqlen": "the length of sequence in each sample, also used as the dimension of query and key tensors",
  "headdim": "the dimension of each head in attention mechanism, determines the shape of Q, K, V tensors",
  "nheads": "the number of attention heads, determines the size of Q, K, V tensors along the last dimension",
  "causal": "a boolean indicating whether to apply causal attention mask for self-attention",
  "window_size": "the size of sliding window in local attention mechanism (if applicable)",
  "alibi_slopes": "the slopes for alibi attention bias (if applicable)",
  "softmax_scale": "a scale used in softmax function to normalize the attention weights"
}
```

These hyperparameters determine the sizes, dimensions, and shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, or those that affect the attention model structure in `flash_attn_2_cuda`. The boolean parameters like `causal` are ignored as they only decide return formats but do not participate in computation.
