==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads in the Transformer model. This parameter determines the number of attention models used in parallel, and hence affects the dimensionality of the input tensor.",
  "headdim": "The dimension of each attention head. This is the last dimension of the input tensor.",
  "window_size": "When using sliding window local attention, this parameter specifies the size of the context window for query at position i to attend to keys between [i - window_size[0], i + window_size[1]] inclusive.",
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor used in the softmax function. This parameter affects how the input tensor is scaled before applying softmax.",
  "dropout_p": "Probability of dropout during training or inference. This parameter determines whether to apply dropout to the output of the attention model.",
  "batch_size", "seqlen": "Batch size and sequence length, respectively. These parameters determine the first two dimensions of the input tensor."
}
```

Note that I have only included hyperparameters that are directly related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` in the output JSON.
