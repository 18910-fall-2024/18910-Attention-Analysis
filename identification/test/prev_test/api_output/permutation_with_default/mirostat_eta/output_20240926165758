Here is the list of hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The total number of input sequences in a batch.",
    "seqlen": "The length of a single sequence.",
    "headdim": "The dimension size of attentional heads.",
    "nheads": "The number of attentional heads.",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
    "window_size": "The size of the sliding window local attention context offset.",
    "alibi_slopes": "The slopes used in alibi approximation for attention scores, can be per-head or batch-wise.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability value to apply during training or inference with attentions."
}
```

All these parameters are hyperparameters influencing the **sizes**, **dimensions**, and **shapes** of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda` , which determines attention model structures in `flash_attn_2_cuda`.

You can find their usage locations as below:

1.  `batch_size`, `seqlen`, `headdim`, `nheads`: These are used in the code snippet under the function `flops` to calculate the computational complexity of FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.

    ```python
f = 4 * batch * seqlen**2 * nheads * headdim // (2 if causal else 1)
```

2.  `causal`: This is used in various locations, such as the function `attention_pytorch` to decide whether applying a causal mask during attention calculation.

    ```python
if causal:
    # .....
```

3.  `window_size`: This is used in `_flash_attn_forward` under FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply.

    ```python
out, q, k, v, out_padded, softmax_lse, S_dmask, rng_state = _flash_attn_forward(
    q, k, v, dropout_p, softmax_scale,
    causal=causal, window_size=window_size,
    alibi_slopes=alibi_slopes,
    return_softmax=return_softmax and dropout_p > 0
)
```

4.  `alibi_slopes`: This is used in `_flash_attn_forward` under FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply.

    ```python
out, q, k,
