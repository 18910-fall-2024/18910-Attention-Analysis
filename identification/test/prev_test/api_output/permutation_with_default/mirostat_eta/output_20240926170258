==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output of **all** the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv_shape": "The input tensor shape, which determines the size of query (Q), key (K) and value (V).",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability during training. Used in both forward and backward passes.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization. Determined by either a pre-defined constant or calculated from head_dim (dimension of attention heads)",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask, often used in autoregressive models.",
  "window_size": "Sliding window size for local attention, which constrains the range of attended keys for each query.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias terms added to attention scores based on absolute differences between query and key positions",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use a deterministic implementation of the backward pass, slightly slower with more memory usage",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to also return softmax-normalized attention probabilities instead of just outputting the final weighted sum"
}
```

Key points:

- You can find `qkv_shape` in all three code snippets related to flash_attn.
- `dropout_p`, `softmax_scale`, and `causal` are all used in flash\_attn.py and are indeed crucial for training with attention mechanism.
- `window_size`, `alibi_slopes`, `deterministic`, and `return_softmax` were referenced in the discussion surrounding the functions related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
