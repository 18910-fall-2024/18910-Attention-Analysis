Here is a JSON object with the identified hyperparameters and their descriptions:

```json
{
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
    "window_size": "Tuple of left/right for implementing sliding window local attention, used in _flash_attn_forward",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score, used in _flash_attn_forward",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_backward",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.backward",
    "return_softmax": "Whether to return attention probabilities in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward",
    "qkv_shape": "Shape of input tensor qkv, used implicitly in _flash_attn_backward",
    "batch_size": "Number of samples in a batch for calculating flops in time_f_bwd",
    "seqlen": "Sequence length for calculating flops in time_f_bwd and time_fwd_bwd",
    "nheads": "Number of attention heads, implicitly used to calculate nheads_dim in _flash_attn_backward",
    "headdim": "Dimension of each attention head, implicitely used in _flash_attn_backward"
}
```

Please note that I ignored the boolean hyperparameters that only decide return format of a function, and also ignored any parameters that are not related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
