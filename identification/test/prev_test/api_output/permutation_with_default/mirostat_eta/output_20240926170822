==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of the input tensor, which determines the number of input sequences that can be processed simultaneously.",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length of the input tensor, which represents the maximum length of an input sequence.",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the multi-head attention mechanism, used to compute the output of flash_attn_2_cuda.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads used in the flash_attn_2_cuda function, which determines the parallelization and efficiency of the attention computation.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention masking, affecting the computation of flash_attn_2_cuda when performing forward passes.",
    "window_size": "A tuple or list specifying the size of the sliding window used for local attention, impacting the scope of key-value interactions in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A set of slopes for alibi attention bias, which are added to the attention scores in flash_attn_2_cuda, influencing the bias and shift of computed attentions."
}
```

All these hyperparameters were identified from different parts of your provided code snippets.
