==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the identified hyperparameters:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to determine the shape of QKV tensor.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of input data, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to determine the shape of QKV tensor.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to split QKV into multiple smaller tensors for parallel computation.",
  "headdim": "The dimension of each attention head, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to determine the shape of QKV tensor.",
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor for softmax function, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to normalize attention weights.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to randomly drop out some attention weights during training.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention mask, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to mask out future tokens when computing attention weights.",
  "window_size": "The size of sliding window for local attention, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to limit the scope of attention computation.",
  "alibi_slopes": "The slopes for alibi bias, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to add a bias term to attention weights based on token positions."
}
```

Note that I ignored the boolean hyperparameters that only decide return format of a function but do nothing with the attention mechanism.
