==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv_shape": "the input tensor shape for flash_attn_2_cuda, which is (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
    "dropout_p": "the dropout probability used in attention mechanism during training",
    "softmax_scale": "the scaling factor of QK^T before applying softmax, default to 1 / sqrt(headdim)",
    "causal": "whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling",
    "window_size": "the size of sliding window local attention, if not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention",
    "alibi_slopes": "a bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j",
    "deterministic": "whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory",
    "return_softmax": "whether to return the attention probabilities, this option is for testing only"
}
```

Note that I ignored boolean hyperparameters like `causal` that only decide the return format but do nothing with the attention mechanism.
