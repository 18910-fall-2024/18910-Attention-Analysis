==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv_shape": "The input tensor shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim) for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax in attention_pytorch and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability in attention_pytorch and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling) in attention_pytorch and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "window_size": "Context window size for local attention in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "batch_size": "Batch size of the input data in time_fwd_bwd and benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b -> .../time_fwd_bwd",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length of the input data in time_fwd_bwd and benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b -> .../time_fwd_bwd",
  "headdim": "Head dimension of the attention model in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and time_fwd_bwd",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and time_fwd_bwd",
  "softmax_scale None": "Default value for softmax scale in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes for attention scores in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func"
}
```

Note that the last one, `softmax_scale=None`, is a default value and not a hyperparameter. I kept it in the output as per your request to include all relevant parameters.
