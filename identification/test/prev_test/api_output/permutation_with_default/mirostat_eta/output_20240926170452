  "return_softmax": "A boolean indicating whether to return softmax values. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward."
}
```

Note that `q`, `k`, and `v` are not hyperparameters, but rather input tensors for `flash_attn_2_cuda`. The dimensions and shapes of these tensors are determined by the other hyperparameters listed above.
