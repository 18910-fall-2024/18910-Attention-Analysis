==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output of the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size used for inputting tensors into flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which determines the size of the first dimension of the input tensor.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length used for inputting tensors into flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which determines the size of the second dimension of the input tensor.",
  "headdim": "The head dimension used for inputting tensors into flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which determines the size of the last two dimensions of the input tensor and also affects the structure of the attention model in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "nheads": "The number of heads used for inputting tensors into flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which determines the repetition factor along the third dimension of the input tensor and indirectly affects the attention model structure in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask or not. If True, it masks off future values outside the context window.",
  "window_size": "The size of the sliding window used for local attention. The tuple (left, right) denotes that queries within [i - left, i + right] will attend to keys at position j within this range.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which determines the probability of dropping out elements during training and affects the output distribution of the attention model.",
  "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor of QK^T before applying softmax. If None, it is set to sqrt(headdim^-1), otherwise it will override this value."
}
```

These hyperparameters are used in various functions along the call chain and ultimately affect the input tensors' sizes, dimensions, shapes, or attention model structure in `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
