==================== Generated Output ====================
Based on the code snippets, I have identified the following hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "window_size": "The window size for the attention mechanism. It is a tuple of two integers representing the window size along the query and key dimensions.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor used in the softmax function to control the output scale. If None, it will be set to the square root of the reciprocal of the feature dimension.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for the attention mechanism.",
  "causal": "Whether to use causal attention or not.",
  "alibi_slopes": "A tuple of three floats representing the alibi slopes for the query, key, and value dimensions. If None, it will be set to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return the softmax output in addition to the final output.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic or stochastic dropout."
}
```

These hyperparameters determine the sizes, dimensions, and shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`. The hyperparameters are used in the following code snippets:

- `FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply`: This function takes in `window_size`, `softmax_scale`, `dropout_p`, `causal`, `alibi_slopes`, `deterministic`, and `return_softmax` as arguments.
- `flash_attn_forward`: This function takes in `qkv_shape`, `dropout_p`, `softmax_scale`, `causal`, `window_size`, `alibi_slopes`, `return_softmax`, and `deterministic` as arguments.

The hyperparameters are derived from the following code snippet:

```python
if softmax_scale is None:
    softmax_scale = qkv.shape[-1] ** (-0.5)
```

This line of code sets `softmax_scale` to the square root of the reciprocal of the feature dimension if it is not provided explicitly. The feature dimension is determined by the shape of the input tensor `qkv`.
