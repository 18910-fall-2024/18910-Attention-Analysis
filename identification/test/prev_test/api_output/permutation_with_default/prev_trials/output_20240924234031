==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the JSON output with the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax, calculated from input tensor shape",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability, determining the number of elements to drop in input tensors q, k, v",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal masking to input sequence, affecting tensor shapes and sizes",
  "window_size": "Window size for attention computation, influencing tensor shapes and sizes",
  "alibi_slopes": "Alibi slopes used in attention computation, possibly affecting tensor shapes and sizes",
  "deterministic": "Determinism flag, possibly influencing random number generation and tensor sizes",
  "return_softmax": "Flag to return softmax output or not, affecting the number of returned tensors"
}
```

Note that I've kept the descriptions concise while still conveying the main idea behind each hyperparameter.
