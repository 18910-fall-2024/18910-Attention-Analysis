==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` from the code snippets:

```json
{
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function, which is set based on input tensor shape",
  "dropout_p": "Probability of applying dropout to input tensors q, k, and v",
  "window_size": "Size of window (or attention mask) used in self-attention calculation. It's a tuple of two integers.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Slopes for alibi lines used in self-attention calculation. It's a list of floats.",
  "causal": "Whether to use causal masking (True) or not (False)",
  "deterministic": "Whether to run the attention computation in deterministic mode",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return softmax output along with output and other intermediate tensors"
}
```

Note that I have considered only the code snippets related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and its functions.
