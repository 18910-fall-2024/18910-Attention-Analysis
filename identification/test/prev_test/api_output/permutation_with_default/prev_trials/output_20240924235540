==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` in the code snippets, along with their descriptions:

```json
{
    "window_size": "A hyperparameter that determines the input tensor's shape and size. It is a tuple of two integers representing the window size for the query and key tensors.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causality in the attention computation (True) or not (False).",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list of float values representing the slopes used in the alibi layers. This hyperparameter determines the input tensor's shape and size, as it is applied to all three tensors (query, key, and value).",
    "softmax_scale": "A scalar value that controls the scaling of the softmax output. This hyperparameter determines the input tensor's shape and size, as it is applied after the dot product operation.",
    "dropout_p": "A float value representing the dropout rate. This hyperparameter determines the input tensor's shape and size, as it is applied to all three tensors (query, key, and value).",
    "deterministic": "A boolean flag indicating whether to use a deterministic version of the attention computation (True) or not (False)."
}
```

In particular, these hyperparameters are used in the following code snippets:

*   `FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply()` function
*   `flash_attn_forward()` function
*   `_flash_attn_forward()` function

The input tensor's shape and size are determined by the following hyperparameters:

*   `window_size`
*   `alibi_slopes`
*   `softmax_scale`
*   `dropout_p`

These hyperparameters are used in the scope of starting point, i.e., in the code that calls the `flash_attn_2_cuda` function.
