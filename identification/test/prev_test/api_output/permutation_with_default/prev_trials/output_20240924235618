==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters with their descriptions:

```
{
    "qkv_shape": "Input tensor shape, a 3D tensor of shape [batch_size, sequence_length, 3]",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function. If None, it is set to qkv.shape[-1] ** (-0.5)",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability (between 0 and 1). If greater than 0, dropout is applied",
    "causal": "Whether to use causal attention or not",
    "window_size": "Window size for local attention. A tuple of two integers (height, width) if local window is used",
    "alibi_slopes": "List of slopes for alibi attention",
    "deterministic": "Whether the attention should be deterministic or not",
    "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return attention probabilities in addition to output"
}
```

All these hyperparameters are used to determine the sizes, dimensions, and shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`. The key parameters that derive the input tensor shape are:

*   "qkv_shape"

The values of these hyperparameters are determined by the function `_flash_attn_forward` in the code snippet.
