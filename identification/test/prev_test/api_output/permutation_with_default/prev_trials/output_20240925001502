```json
{
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied to the query-key dot products before computing softmax. It is typically set to 1/sqrt(d_k), where d_k is the key dimension.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used during training for dropout layers in attention mechanisms.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether the attention mechanism should be causal (i.e., only attend to previous positions) or not. This affects the shape and computation of the softmax output.",
    "window_size": "A tuple specifying a local window size within which attention is computed, reducing computational complexity for long sequences. It determines the dimensions over which the attention mechanism operates locally.",
    "deterministic": "A boolean indicating whether to use deterministic or nondeterministic behavior in CUDA kernels. This affects the reproducibility of results but may impact performance.",
    "return_attn_probs": "A boolean indicating whether to return the softmax probabilities along with the output tensor from the attention mechanism."
