==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the list of hyperparameters with their descriptions:

```json
{
    "qkv": "The input tensor representing query, key, and value in a transformer attention mechanism. It's a 3D tensor (batch_size, sequence_length, embed_dim) that contains the query, key, and value embeddings for each position in the input sequence.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used to randomly drop out some of the output elements in order to prevent overfitting. In the context of attention mechanisms, it's often used to add some noise to the attention weights.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied to the softmax function when computing attention weights. It can help stabilize the training process by avoiding extremely large or small attention values.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether the attention mechanism should be causal, meaning that it only considers previous positions in the input sequence. This is often used for tasks like language modeling where the model needs to predict future words based on past context.",
    "window_size": "The size of the window or context used by the attention mechanism when computing attention weights. In the context of Transformers, this can be used to implement attention mechanisms that consider only a subset of the input sequence.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list of slopes used for alibi (also known as "slope-based" or "scaled sigmoid") attention. This is an alternative way to compute attention weights compared to traditional softmax.",
    "return_softmax": "A boolean flag indicating whether the attention mechanism should return the attention weights in addition to the output tensor."
