```json
{
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used during training to randomly drop elements from the attention matrix. It is passed as an argument to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and affects the shape of the output tensor's mask.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied to the query-key dot product before applying softmax. This hyperparameter influences the dynamic range of the softmax function, but does not directly determine input tensor shapes or dimensions.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether causal attention (masking out future tokens) should be used during inference. This parameter affects the shape and mask patterns in the output tensors generated by `flash_attn_2_cuda`.",
    "window_size": "A tuple specifying the window size for local or global self-attention mechanisms, affecting how far each token can attend within its sequence. It determines the dimensions of input tensors like queries (q), keys (k), and values (v) in terms of their temporal locality constraints.",
    "alibi_slopes": "An array of slopes used with the ALiBi bias for relative position encoding, affecting how attention weights are modified based on token positions. This hyperparameter can influence the dimensions or shape required by input tensors related to positional embeddings.",
    "return_softmax": "A boolean indicating whether `flash_attn_2_cuda` should return the softmax output along with the usual attention results. This parameter affects the structure of returned values from the function but does not directly determine tensor shapes."
