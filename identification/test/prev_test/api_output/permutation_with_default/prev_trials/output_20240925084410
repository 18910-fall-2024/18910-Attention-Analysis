    "dropout_p": "The probability of dropping out elements during attention computation. This is used to control overfitting.",
    "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor for the softmax operation in self-attention, typically set as the inverse square root of the dimension size (d) of the queries and keys.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether the attention pattern should be causal or not. If True, only the past elements can attend to each other; if False, all elements can attend to each other.",
    "window_size": "A tuple defining the window size in both dimensions for local (block) attention. Local attention restricts which elements a given element can attend to based on this window size.",
