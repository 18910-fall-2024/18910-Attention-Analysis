==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor q, k, v of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim) used in flash_attn_forward and flash_attn_backward",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism used in flash_attn_forward and backward functions to randomly set some output elements as zero during training.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function used in flash_attn_forward and backward to normalize the attention weights, default value is sequence_length^(-0.5) if not provided",
    "causal": "Flag indicating whether the model should use causal masking or not when computing self-attention between sequence elements within a window size specified by window_size parameter",
    "window_size": "The maximum number of tokens in each sequence chunk, used as input to flash_attn_forward function for padding and masking. It is a tuple (head_num, sequence_length) specifying the head dimension and the maximum length of sequences respectively.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list of alibi slopes for different layers in attention model specified by window_size parameter",
    "deterministic": "Flag indicating whether to use deterministic or random behavior during training process. If True, then this function will not apply dropout during forward pass.",
    "return_attn_probs": "Flag deciding the output format when applying flash_attn_forward. It can either return only the attention output 'out' or in addition a tuple (out, softmax_lse, S_dmask) containing also softmax normalized log-softmax of weights and its derivative."
}
```

Note that I ignored `return_softmax` because it's just a helper flag for `flash_attn_forward` function to decide whether return the softmax output.
