{
    "dropout_p": "A hyperparameter used in the forward and backward functions of FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc. It represents the dropout probability applied during the attention mechanism.",
    "softmax_scale": "A hyperparameter used in the forward function to scale the query-key product before applying softmax, which helps stabilize the computation of attention scores.",
    "causal": "A boolean hyperparameter used in the _flash_attn_forward function to indicate whether causal masking is required (i.e., for autoregressive models).",
    "window_size": "A hyperparameter used in the forward and backward functions to specify the window size for local attention. It determines the extent of the context that each position attends to.",
    "alibi_slopes": "An array-like hyperparameter passed to _flash_attn_forward, which contains slopes for ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) positional encodings. This helps in controlling the influence of relative positions on attention scores.",
    "return_softmax": "A boolean hyperparameter used in the forward function to indicate whether the softmax output should be returned along with the main output."
