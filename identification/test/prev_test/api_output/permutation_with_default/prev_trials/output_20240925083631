==================== Generated Output ====================
Based on the code snippets, here is the output JSON:

```json
{
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax operation in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used to randomly zero out elements in attention weights in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "causal": "Whether to use causal masking in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "window_size": "Window size for local attention computation in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "alibi_slopes": "Alibi slopes for attention weights computation in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return softmax output alongside attention weights in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "qkv_shape": "Shape of input tensor qkv in forward method of Class",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used to randomly zero out elements in attention weights in backward method of Class"
}
```

However, since you asked me to identify and list the hyperparameters that determine the sizes, dimensions, and shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, I also identified `m`, `n` and `d` from the provided example. Here is the updated JSON:

```json

  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax operation in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used to randomly zero out elements in attention weights in flash_attn_forward method of Class",

  "window_size": "Window size for local attention computation in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "alibi_slopes": "Alibi slopes for attention weights computation in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "return_softmax": "Whether to return softmax output alongside attention weights in flash_attn_forward method of Class",
  "qkv_shape": "Shape of input tensor qkv in forward method of Class",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used to randomly zero out elements in attention weights in backward method of Class",
  "m": "Input dimensionality m in torch.full((3,4),7) code snippet",
  "n": "Sub-dimensionality n in torch.full((3,4),7) code snippet",
