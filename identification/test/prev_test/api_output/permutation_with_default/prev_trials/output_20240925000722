{
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used during training to drop out attention weights. It is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the model and helps prevent overfitting.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied to the dot product in the softmax function, which can improve numerical stability. If not provided, it defaults to 1/sqrt(d_k), where d_k is the key dimension.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether the attention mechanism should be causal (i.e., only attending to past and current positions) or non-causal (allowing all positions).",
    "window_size": "A tuple specifying the local window size for local self-attention. It determines the range of tokens each position attends to, which can significantly affect computational efficiency and model capacity.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list of slopes used in ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) mechanism, which biases attention weights based on distance without adding extra parameters. This is an optional hyperparameter for positional bias.",
    "return_attn_probs": "A boolean indicating whether to return the raw attention probabilities along with the output tensor from the Flash Attention function. It is not a direct input shape or dimension parameter but affects the output structure."
