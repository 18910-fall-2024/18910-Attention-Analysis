==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters within the starting point scope that determine or influence the arguments passed and inputs to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "dropout_p": "Controls the amount of dropout applied during attention calculation",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function; if None, uses qkv.shape[-1] ** (-0.5)",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal masking in attention calculation",
    "window_size": "Size of window used in attention calculation (only applicable when causal=True)",
    "alibi_slopes": "Slopes for alibi regularization (only applicable when return_softmax=True)",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic dropout or not"
}
```

Note that `rng_state` is not a hyperparameter but rather an internal state used by the autograd system. I've excluded it from the list.

Also, keep in mind that these descriptions are my own interpretation of the code and may not be exact quotes from any documentation.
