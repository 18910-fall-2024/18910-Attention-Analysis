{
    "dropout_p": "A hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward that determines the dropout probability for the attention mechanism. It is passed to _flash_attn_forward where it influences the random mask applied during training.",
    "softmax_scale": "A hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward and _flash_attn_forward that scales the query-key dot products before applying softmax. This can be None, in which case it defaults to qkv.shape[-1] ** (-0.5), a common scaling factor for attention scores.",
    "causal": "A boolean hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward and _flash_attn_forward that indicates whether the attention mechanism should enforce causal masking (i.e., future tokens cannot influence past tokens).",
    "window_size": "An integer tuple hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward and _flash_attn_forward to specify a local window size for computing attention scores. This can be useful for reducing computational complexity by limiting the number of tokens considered.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list or tensor hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward and _flash_attn_forward that provides slopes for ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) to adjust attention scores based on distance. This can be None if not using ALiBi.",
    "return_softmax": "A boolean hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward and _flash_attn_forward indicating whether to return the softmax probabilities along with the output tensor."
