```json
{
    "dropout_p": "A hyperparameter used in FlashAttention function to control the dropout probability during training. It does not affect tensor sizes or dimensions directly but is passed as an argument.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor for the softmax operation which can be set based on the dimension of query and key vectors, though it doesn't influence tensor shapes explicitly.",
    "causal": "Boolean flag indicating whether to enforce causal masking in self-attention. It does not directly affect tensor sizes or dimensions but is used as an input argument.",
    "window_size": "A tuple (left, right) that defines the window size for local attention. This affects how far each position looks left and right when computing attention weights. It influences the effective shape of tensors in context.",
    "alibi_slopes": "An optional tensor containing slopes used for ALiBi bias. The length of this tensor determines how many different biases are applied, influencing the computation but not directly shaping input tensors.",
    "return_attn_probs": "A boolean indicating whether to return attention probabilities along with outputs. It does not affect tensor sizes or dimensions directly but is passed as an argument."
