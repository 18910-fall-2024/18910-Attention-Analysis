I identified the following hyperparameters:

1. `softmax_scale`: scale factor for softmax calculation.
2. `dropout_p`: probability of dropout.
3. `causal`: flag to indicate if causal attention is used.
4. `window_size`: size of window for local attention.
5. `alibi_slopes`: slope for alibi attention.
6. `deterministic`: flag to indicate if deterministic sampling is used.
7. `return_softmax`: flag to indicate if softmax output should be returned.

Note that some of these hyperparameters are not directly related to the input tensor shape, but rather control the behavior of the forward and backward passes.
