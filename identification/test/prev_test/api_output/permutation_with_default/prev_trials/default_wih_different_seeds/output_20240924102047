==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters within the starting point scope that determine or influence the arguments passed and inputs to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "seq_len": "The maximum sequence length. This determines the size of input tensors and affects the output shape.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads. This influences the structure of the model, specifically the output dimensions.",
  "batch_size": "The batch size of the input data. This determines the size of the input tensor and affects the output shape.",
  "window_size": "The window size for causal attention. This influences the computation of causal attention weights.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability. This affects the number of elements in the output tensor that are kept or dropped during training.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scale factor for softmax normalization. This can influence the magnitude of the output values.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to use causal attention. This determines the computation of attention weights.",
  "alibi_slopes": "The slopes for alibi attention. This influences the computation of attention weights for each alibi layer.",
  "deterministic": "A boolean flag indicating whether to perform deterministic computations. This affects the output values and can influence the training process.",
  "return_attn_probs": "A boolean flag indicating whether to return attention probabilities in addition to the output tensor."
}
```

Note that some of these hyperparameters may not be explicitly mentioned in the code, but are commonly used in Transformer models or have an effect on the computation.
