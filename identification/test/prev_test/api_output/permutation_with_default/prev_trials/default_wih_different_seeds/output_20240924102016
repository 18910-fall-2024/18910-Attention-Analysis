==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters within the starting point scope that determine or influence the arguments passed and inputs to flash_attn_2_cuda, according to my understanding of the code:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The number of input sequences in a batch.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads used in the model.",
  "seqlen": "The length of each input sequence.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used during training.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied to the softmax output.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether causal masking is used.",
  "window_size": "A tuple containing the window size for the attention computation.",
  "alibi_slopes": "A list of alibi slopes used in the model.",
  "deterministic": "A boolean flag indicating whether the model should be deterministic."
}
```
