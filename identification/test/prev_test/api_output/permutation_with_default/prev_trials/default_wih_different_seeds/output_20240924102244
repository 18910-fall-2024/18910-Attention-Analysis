==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters that influence the structure or inputs of the model, as well as those within the starting point scope:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "Determines the size of the input tensor for batched attention",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length of the input sequence (both for query and key)",
  "dropout_p": "Probability of dropping out certain locations during self-attention",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied to the softmax output, defaults to qkv.shape[-1]**(-0.5)",
  "causal": "Whether causal masking is applied during attention",
  "window_size": "Window size for local window attention (if used)",
  "alibi_slopes": "Slopes for alibi attention (if used), typically used in combination with window_size",
  "deterministic": "Whether the model should operate in deterministic mode (e.g., no random number generation)",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return the softmax output probabilities instead of only the output"
}
```
