==================== Generated Output ====================
Based on the provided code, I've identified the following hyperparameters within the starting point scope:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The number of input sequences to process in parallel.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the multi-head self-attention mechanism.",
  "seqlen": "The length of the input sequence.",
  "dropout_p": "The probability of dropping out units in the self-attention mechanism.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor to apply to the softmax output, or None for default scaling.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal masking (i.e., prevent looking at future positions) in the attention mechanism.",
  "window_size": "The window size to use when applying local attention mechanisms.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Slope values to use for alibi attention mechanisms, or None for default slopes.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic initialization and computations, or not.",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return the attention probabilities along with the output."
}
```

These hyperparameters influence the arguments passed to `flash_attn_2_cuda` by determining the structure of the input tensors (`qkv`, `dropout_p`, etc.) that are used as inputs to this function.
