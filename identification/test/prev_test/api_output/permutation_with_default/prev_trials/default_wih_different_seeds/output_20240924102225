==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters within the starting point scope that determine or influence the arguments passed and inputs to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The number of input sequences in a batch.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the Transformer model.",
    "seqlen": "The length of the input sequence (i.e., the number of tokens).",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for attention weights, which determines whether to apply dropout during computation or not.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied to the output of softmax function. It can be set manually or automatically based on input shape.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether the attention is causal (i.e., only considering previous tokens) or not.",
    "window_size": "The size of the window for applying local attention weights. This determines how many preceding and succeeding tokens are considered when computing attention weights.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A tuple containing two elements, which represent the slopes used for alibi attention computation (i.e., calculating weights).",
    "deterministic": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply deterministic or stochastic operations during computation.",
    "return_attn_probs": "A boolean flag determining whether to return attention probabilities or not."
}
