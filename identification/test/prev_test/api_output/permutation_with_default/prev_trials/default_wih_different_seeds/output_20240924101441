==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is the list of hyperparameters within the starting point scope that determine or influence the arguments passed and inputs to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "Number of examples in a single forward pass",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads used in the Transformer model",
  "seqlen": "Length of input sequences (determines the size of Q, K, V tensors)",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for the attention mechanism",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied to the softmax output",
  "causal": "Whether to use causal masking in the attention mechanism",
  "window_size": "Size of the window used for local attention (only relevant if causal=True)",
  "alibi_slopes": "Slopes used for alibi attention (only relevant if causal=False)",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic or stochastic sampling for alibi attention",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return the attention probabilities in addition to the output"
}
```

Note that `rng_state` is also a hyperparameter, but it's not explicitly set anywhere in the code. It's likely used as a random seed for reproducibility purposes.
