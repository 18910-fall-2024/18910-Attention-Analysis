```json
{
    "dropout_p": "A hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and _flash_attn_forward(). It represents the probability of an element being zeroed (dropped out) during training, which is used to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.",
    "softmax_scale": "A hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and _flash_attn_forward(). If None, it defaults to 1/sqrt(d_k), where d_k is the key dimension. This parameter scales the logits before applying the softmax function, which can improve numerical stability.",
    "causal": "A boolean hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and _flash_attn_forward(). It indicates whether to enforce a causal (autoregressive) mask on the attention mechanism, meaning that each position can only attend to previous positions.",
    "window_size": "A tuple of integers used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and _flash_attn_forward(). It specifies the window size for local attention. The first element is the vertical (sequence length) dimension and the second element is the horizontal (number of heads) dimension.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list or tensor used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and _flash_attn_forward(). It contains slopes to be applied to attention logits for each head, which can help with modeling long-range dependencies. This is often used in models like Reformer.",
    "deterministic": "A boolean hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward(). If True, it ensures deterministic behavior by setting the random number generator state before calling the CUDA kernel. This is useful for testing and debugging.",
    "return_softmax": "A boolean hyperparameter used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and _flash_attn_forward(). It indicates whether to return the softmax probabilities alongside the output tensor, which can be useful for analysis or visualization."
