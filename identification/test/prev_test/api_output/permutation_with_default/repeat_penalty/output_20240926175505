==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are a list of **all** relevant parameters (as hyperparameters) and their purpose:

Please note that some function calls may not have been included in the provided code snippets, but I assume they would also be similar.

The final output is as follows:
 
 ```json
{
    "qkv": {
        "*description*":"Q,K,V tensor input to flash_attn_2_cuda; q,k,v tensors are for QKV attention mechanism. This determines sizes of the query key and value matrices.",
	"dropout_p":{"batch_size,sequence_length,batch-size-dependent dropout_probabilities (used in training or inference)"},"softmax_scale": "*description*":"The scaling factor used to normalize softmax distribution before applying it on flash_attn_2_cuda; scale_factor for QK.T matrix",

Please let me know if there are any issues.
