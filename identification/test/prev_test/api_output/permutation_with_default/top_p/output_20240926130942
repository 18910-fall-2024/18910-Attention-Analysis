==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The number of batches in the input data, used as a hyperparameter for memory-efficient attention calculation.",
    "seqlen": "The length of each sequence in the input data, used as a hyperparameter for window_size and alibi_slopes.",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the transformer model, used as a hyperparameter for softmax_scale.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads in the transformer model, calculated from headdim.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention mask, used as a hyperparameter for window_size and alibi_slopes.",
    "window_size": "A tuple indicating the size of the sliding window for local attention, used as a hyperparameter with causal.",
    "alibi_slopes": "An array of slopes for the attention bias, used as a hyperparameter with causal.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for attention calculations, used as a hyperparameter to improve model robustness."
}
```

These hyperparameters are used in various functions along the call chain, including `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`, `_flash_attn_forward`, and `flash_attn_cuda.fwd`. They determine the sizes, dimensions, and shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda` or influence the attention model structure in this function.
