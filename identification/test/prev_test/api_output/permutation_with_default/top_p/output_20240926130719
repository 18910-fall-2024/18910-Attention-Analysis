==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). This is the input shape for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. This is a hyperparameter used in both forward and backward passes of attention mechanisms.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax. If not provided, it will be set to 1 / sqrt(headdim).",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "Sliding window size for local attention. If (-1, -1), implements global attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads in a Transformer model.",
  "headdim": "Dimension of each attention head in a Transformer model.",
  "batch_size": "Batch size for input data. This is used to compute the number of attention heads (nheads) from headdim.",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length for input data. This determines the size of the input tensor qkv."
}
```

Note that `qkv` is a tensor shape and not a hyperparameter in the classical sense, but it's included here as it's an important parameter for `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
