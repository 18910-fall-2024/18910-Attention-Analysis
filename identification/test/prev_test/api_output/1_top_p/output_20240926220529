==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON object containing the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "qkv_shape": "(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
  "dropout_p": "float. Dropout probability.",
  "softmax_scale": "None or float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.",
  "causal": "bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "(left, right) If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "(nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j."
}
```

Here's a brief description for each parameter:

- **qkv_shape**: The shape of input tensor `qkv` in function `_flash_attn_forward`. It determines the sizes, dimensions, or shapes of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
  
- **dropout_p**: A hyperparameter used in functions like `attention_pytorch`, `FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.apply`, and others. It is a float representing dropout probability.

- **softmax_scale**: This parameter determines the scaling factor for softmax operation, which affects attention mechanism's output.
 
- **causal**: Whether to apply causal mask or not in functions like `_flash_attn_forward` and `attention_pytorch`. Causal masking can be used when training auto-regressive models where each token is predicted based on previous tokens.

- **window_size**: This parameter determines the size of sliding window for local attention mechanism. It's a tuple representing left and right context sizes.
 
- **alibi_slopes**: A bias term added to attention scores in functions like `_flash_attn_forward`. The slopes are used as weights when computing attention probabilities.

Note that I ignored boolean hyperparameters such as `return_softmax` which only decide return format of function but do nothing with the attention mechanism.
