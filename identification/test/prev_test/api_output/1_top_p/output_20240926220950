Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input data for attention mechanism, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of input data for attention mechanism, used in time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "headdim": "The head dimension (or the number of hidden units) per query or key vector for multi-head self-attention, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads for multi-head self-attention, calculated as dim // headdim, where dim is a hyperparameter for the model dimensionality. Used in flops and time_fwd_bwd.",
  "causal": "A boolean indicating whether to apply causal (or triangular) attention mask during computation. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "The size of sliding window for local self-attention, used as a hyperparameter for context windowing mechanism in _flash_attn_forward. It can be (-1, -1), indicating no windowing",
  "alibi_slopes": "A list or tensor representing the slopes (or bias terms) added to attention scores between each query and key pair during computation. Used as a hyperparameter for alibi self-attention mechanism in _flash_attn_forward.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used for regularization of model outputs, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, time_fwd_bwd, and flops."
