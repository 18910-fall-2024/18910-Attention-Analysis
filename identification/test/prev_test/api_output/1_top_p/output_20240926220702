==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON output of the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). The input qkv should be in this format.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. Used for training or inference with attention mechanism.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim)",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "(left, right) If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j. Used for testing only.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass (slower but uses more memory).",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return attention probabilities (for testing only)",
  "batch_size": "Size of batch in input tensor qkv, used as a hyperparameter for training or inference with attention mechanism.",
  "seqlen": "Sequence length in input tensor qkv. Used as a hyperparameter for training or inference with attention mechanism.",
  "nheads": "Number of heads in Transformer model structure. Determined by the size of headdim",
  "headdim": "Size of each head dimension, used to determine nheads and softmax_scale"
}
```

Note that I have only included hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` as per your request. The other parameters in the code snippets are not directly related to this function call chain.
