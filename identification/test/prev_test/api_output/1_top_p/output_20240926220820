==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` along with their descriptions:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). QKV is a packed input of query, key and value tensors.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention output. It should be set to 0.0 during evaluation.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization in the forward pass.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "Sliding window size left and right from each position i, where query at position i will only attend to keys between [i - window_size[0], i + window_size[1]] inclusive.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes added to attention scores for alibi regularization. It can be (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads) in shape and fp32 data type.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more return_softmax: Whether to return attention probabilities during forward computation."
}
```

Note that I've included `qkv` as a hyperparameter since it determines the input tensor shape for `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
