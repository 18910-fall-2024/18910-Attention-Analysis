Here are the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input data for attention mechanism, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of input data for attention mechanism, used in time_fwd_bwd and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "headdim": "The head dimension (or the number of hidden units) per query or key vector for multi-head self-attention, used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads for multi-head self-attention, calculated as dim // headdim, where dim is a hyperparameter input to the function time_fwd_bwd or config variable in benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention,time_f_b -> ...",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (True) or not (False), used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "window_size": "(left, right). If specified, it implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i will only attend to keys between [i - left, i + right] inclusive., used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "alibi_slopes": "A bias of (-slope * |i-j|) is added to the attention score for query i and key j, where slope is either a pre-defined value or can be specified per head (in case of multi-head self-attention), used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. When dropout_p > 0, it will apply dropout to the attention weights before returning output., used in _flash_attn_forward and benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention,time_fwd_bwd"
