==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "qkv_shape": "(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
  "window_size": "[left, right]",
  "alibi_slopes": "[(nheads,), (batch_size, nheads)], fp32",
  "dropout_p": "float. Dropout probability.",
  "softmax_scale": "None or float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax."
}
```

The identified hyperparameters are:

- `qkv_shape`: the shape of input tensor to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, which is `(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)`.
- `window_size`: a tuple `[left, right]` that determines the size of context window for sliding window local attention.
- `alibi_slopes`: an array or tensor representing bias values to be added to attention scores in each head (either per-head slopes `(nheads,)`, or batched slopes `(batch_size, nheads)`).
- `dropout_p`: a float that determines the dropout probability during training for the output of attention mechanism.
- `softmax_scale`: either None (which means using default scaling) or a custom scale factor to be applied before softmax operation.
