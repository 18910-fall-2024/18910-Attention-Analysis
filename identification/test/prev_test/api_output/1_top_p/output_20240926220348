==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **all** hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size for the input sequence. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "seqlen": "The length of the input sequence. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads used in the Transformer model. Calculated as dim // headdim, where dim is 2048 and headdim is a hyperparameter.",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the Transformer model. Used to calculate nheads.",
    "causal": "A boolean indicating whether causal attention should be applied (True) or not (False).",
    "window_size": "A tuple representing the size of the sliding window for local attention, where (-1,-1) means infinite context window.",
    "alibi_slopes": "The slopes used in alibi attention. Can be a tensor with shape (nheads,) or (batch_size,nheads).",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability used during training to randomly drop out some of the output elements."
}
```

Note that I have ignored boolean hyperparameters like `return_attn_probs` and focused on those determining sizes, dimensions, shapes, attention model structures in `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
