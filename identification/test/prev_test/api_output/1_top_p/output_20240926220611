==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON output of the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). The input qkv should be in this format for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward to work properly.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. This hyperparameter is used during training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. Default value: sqrt(headdim).",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling)",
  "window_size": "(left, right) If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j. This hyperparameter determines the shape or size of input tensors in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory.",
  "return_softmax": "Return softmax probabilities instead of output tensor."
}
```

Note that `q`, `k` and `v` are not included in the JSON as they seem to be just parts of the input qkv tensor.
