    "nheads": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Number of parallel attention heads, a hyperparameter that defines the depth and complexity of Transformers' architecture by splitting input into multiple smaller vectors for processing through separate channels before recombining them.",
    "dropout_p": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function definition] Dropout probability used during training to prevent overfitting in Transformer models. It does not affect inference directly unless explicitly set.",

    "causal": "[_flash_attn_forward function definition] Boolean flag indicating whether causal (autoregressive) masking should be used during training or inference. It restricts tokens from attending future positions in sequences which is essential for autoregressive language modeling tasks like text generation and translation."
