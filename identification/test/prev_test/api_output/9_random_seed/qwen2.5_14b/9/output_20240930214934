    "dropout_p": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func parameters] Dropout probability for training to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some elements in the tensor to zero during forward pass. It does not affect inference directly but is crucial for model regularization during training.",
