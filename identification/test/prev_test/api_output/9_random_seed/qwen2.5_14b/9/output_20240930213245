{
    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The number of sequences processed in parallel during training or inference.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Length (number of tokens) of the input sequence for each batch element. This determines the size and shape of tensors like Q, K, V matrices used as inputs to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The dimensionality or width of individual attention heads in a multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer models.",
    "nheads": "[configurations inside time_fwd_bwd loop] Number of parallel attention heads used by the model. This parameter influences tensor dimensions such as Q, K, V matrices and output tensors from `flash_attn_2_cuda` functions.",
    "dropout_p": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Dropout probability for training purposes to prevent overfitting during attention mechanism computation within the Transformer model. This parameter is passed directly into `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd`. It does not affect inference where dropout should be set to 0.",
    "softmax_scale": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Scaling factor applied before computing softmax in attention mechanism, often scaled by the square root of head dimension. This parameter is passed directly into `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd` and influences how QK^T matrix values are normalized.",
    "causal": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Boolean indicating whether to apply causal attention mask, which restricts each token in the sequence from attending to future tokens. This parameter is passed directly into `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd` and influences how QK^T matrix values are masked.",
    "window_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Tuple indicating left (negative) or right (positive) context window size for local attention. This parameter is passed directly into `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd` and influences the scope of QK^T matrix values considered in each token's computation.",
    "alibi_slopes": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Slope for ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) to introduce bias based on distance between tokens. This parameter is passed directly into `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd` and influences how QK^T matrix values are biased."
