{
    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The batch size of input tensors for attention mechanism, determining the number of sequences processed in parallel.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Sequence length or context window size per sequence. It determines how many tokens are considered at once during self-attention computation within a single sequence.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The dimension of each attention head, which is crucial for determining the model's capacity and computational complexity in terms of memory usage and FLOPs (floating-point operations).",
    "nheads": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func/FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward/_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Number of parallel attention heads, which is a hyperparameter that influences the model's ability to capture different aspects or features from input sequences.",
    "dropout_p": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain and _flash_attn_forward function call chain] Dropout probability used during training for regularization. It does not affect inference but impacts how dropout masks are applied in attention mechanisms, affecting both forward pass computation of output tensors as well as backward propagation gradients.",
    "softmax_scale": "_[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward/_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Scaling factor to be used before applying softmax on the dot product between query and key vectors. This hyperparameter can influence numerical stability during attention score calculation, especially when dealing with high-dimensional embeddings or large sequence lengths.",
    "causal": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain and _flash_attn_forward function call chain] Boolean indicating whether to apply a causal mask in the self-attention mechanism (True for autoregressive models like language modeling). This parameter determines if attention can only be from past tokens, impacting how sequences are processed.",
    "window_size": "_[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward/_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Tuple indicating left and right context window sizes in local self-attention. It restricts the range of keys that a query attends to within its vicinity (e.g., for efficient computation or modeling short-range dependencies).",
    "alibi_slopes": "_[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward/_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Slope values used in ALiBi bias, which is an alternative approach to positional encoding. It influences how the attention scores are adjusted based on relative positions between queries and keys."
