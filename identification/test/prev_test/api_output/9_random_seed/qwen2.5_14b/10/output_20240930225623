    "nheads": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function definition] Number of parallel attention heads, a hyperparameter that determines the number of independent attention computations performed simultaneously and combined at each layer in transformer architectures.",
    "dropout_p": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function definition] Dropout probability used during training to randomly drop (set to zero) some elements from input tensors, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust. It is a scalar value indicating the chance of dropping an element.",
    "softmax_scale": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func -> _flash_attn_forward] Scaling factor applied before computing softmax in attention mechanism; it can be manually set or calculated as 1/sqrt(headdim) if not provided, affecting how normalized scores are computed between queries and keys.",
    "causal": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func -> _flash_attn_forward] Boolean indicating whether to apply a causal mask in the attention mechanism. When set to True, it restricts each position's access only to previous positions (useful for autoregressive models).",
    "window_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain -> flash_attn_qkvpacked_func -> _flash_attn_forward] Tuple indicating local window size around current token in sequence. Used when implementing sliding-window attention, where each query attends within a limited context.",
