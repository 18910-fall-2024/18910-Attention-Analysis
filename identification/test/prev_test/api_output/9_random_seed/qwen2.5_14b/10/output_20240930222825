{
    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The number of sequences processed in parallel. It determines the batch dimension size for input tensors.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Sequence length, which is used to determine the sequence dimensions (e.g., seqlen) of QKV matrices and attention masks.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The dimensionality of each head in multi-head self-attention. It affects tensor shapes such as qkv tensors' last two dimensions: nheads, headdim.",
    "nheads": "[_flash_attn_forward function] Number of attention heads used for the Transformer model's architecture; it influences QKV matrices and output tensor shape (batch_size, seqlen, nheads * headdim).",
    "dropout_p": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain], [FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc forward method] Dropout probability applied during training to prevent overfitting. It is a hyperparameter that influences the backward pass and dropout mask generation.",
    "softmax_scale": "_flash_attn_forward The scaling factor used in computing attention scores (before applying softmax). This parameter can affect numerical stability of QKV dot products, especially when dealing with large dimensions or high precision tensors.",
    "causal": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain], [_flash_attn_forward] Boolean indicating whether to apply a causal mask during self-attention. It affects the attention pattern by masking future tokens in sequence data (e.g., language modeling).",
    "window_size": "_flash_attn_forward A tuple specifying local window size for sliding-window based locality-sensitive attention mechanism, which restricts each query's context range.",
    "alibi_slopes": "[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc forward method] An optional parameter that introduces a bias to the attention scores in order to handle long sequences better. It can be used to adjust relative position biases between queries and keys."
