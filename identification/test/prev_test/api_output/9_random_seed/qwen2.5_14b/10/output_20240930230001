    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The batch size of input sequences in Transformer models.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Sequence length or the number of tokens in each sequence within a batch for Transformers.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Dimensionality (size) of individual attention heads. This hyperparameter determines the size and shape of tensors input to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.",
    "nheads": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Number of parallel attention heads in a Transformer layer, which affects tensor dimensions passed into flash attention functions.",
    "dropout_p": "[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward method] Dropout probability used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some activations to zero. It does not affect the shape or size but is crucial for model regularization and inference quality control.",
    "softmax_scale": "[_flash_attn_forward method] Scaling factor applied before computing softmax in attention mechanism, which can influence numerical stability without changing tensor dimensions directly.",
    "causal": "[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward method] Boolean indicating whether to apply causal masking (for autoregressive models). Although it is a boolean parameter, its role affects the computation and structure of tensors passed into `flash_attn_2_cuda` by enforcing certain patterns in attention scores.",
    "window_size": "[FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward method] Tuple indicating left and right context window sizes for local self-attention. This hyperparameter determines how far each position can attend within the sequence, affecting tensor dimensions indirectly through padding or truncation."
