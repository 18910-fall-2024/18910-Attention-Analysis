    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The batch size of input tensors in Transformer models, determining the number of sequences processed simultaneously.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Sequence length or context window size for each sequence within a batch. It defines how many tokens are considered at once during attention computation.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The dimensionality (size) of the hidden state vectors in multi-head self-attention mechanisms, also known as head dimensions.",
    "nheads": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Number of heads used for parallel processing within a single attention layer. It is derived from `dim` and `headdim`, where `dim = nheads * headdim`. This parameter determines the model's capacity to capture diverse patterns in data.",
    "dropout_p": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function] Dropout probability used during training for regularization, preventing overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero. It is set to 0.0 during evaluation/inference phases.",
    "softmax_scale": "_flash_attn_forward (derived from headdim) The scaling factor applied before computing the softmax operation in attention mechanisms. If not provided explicitly, it defaults to `1 / sqrt(headdim)` which normalizes scores based on head dimension size.",
    "causal": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Boolean indicating whether causal (masked) self-attention is used for autoregressive models like language modeling where future tokens cannot influence past ones. This parameter influences the attention mask applied during computation."
