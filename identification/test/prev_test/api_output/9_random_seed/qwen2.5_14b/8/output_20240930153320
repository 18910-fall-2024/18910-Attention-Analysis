{
    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] The batch size determines the number of sequences processed in parallel during training or inference.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Sequence length specifies how long each sequence is, impacting memory and computation requirements for attention mechanisms.",
    "headdim": "[flops/time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Head dimension size defines the dimensions of individual heads in multi-head self-attention layers within transformers.",
    "nheads": "[time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_qkvpacked_func] Number of attention heads used to determine parallelism and model capacity for transformer architectures.",
    "dropout_p": "[_flash_attn_forward/time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward] Dropout probability controls the randomness during training, preventing overfitting by randomly dropping units from a layer with a certain probability.",
    "softmax_scale": "_[_flash_attn_forward/time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward] Softmax scale adjusts the scaling factor for Q*K^T before applying softmax, influencing attention scores and stability of computations.",
    "causal": "[_flash_attn_forward/time_fwd_brdw/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface._flash_attn_forward] Causal flag determines if causal (or masked) self-attention is used in transformers to ensure that each position's predictions depend only on earlier positions, commonly seen during autoregressive language modeling tasks.",
    "window_size": "[_flash_attn_forward/time_fwd_bwd/flash_attn.flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward] Window size defines the local attention window for sliding-window self-attention mechanisms in transformers to limit computational complexity and memory usage by focusing on a smaller context."
