{
    "batch_size": "[code snippet starting point, time_fwd_bwd function call] Determines the number of sequences processed in parallel during training or inference.",
    "seqlen": "[code snippet starting point, time_fwd_bwd function call] Specifies the sequence length for each input batch. This parameter determines how many tokens are considered per sequence.",
    "headdim": "[code snippet starting point, time_fwd_bwd function call] Represents the dimension of each head in a multi-head attention mechanism within Transformers.",
    "nheads": "[code snippet starting point, flops definition] The number of heads used in the multi-headed self-attention layer. This parameter is derived from `dim` and `headdim`. It determines how many parallel attention mechanisms are applied to different subspaces (or 'heads') of the input.",
    "dropout_p": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func function] Specifies the dropout probability used during training for regularization, preventing overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of output features to zero. This parameter is passed directly into `flash_attn_2_cuda` and affects how attention scores are dropped out.",
    "softmax_scale": "_flash_attn_forward(_flash_attn_backward) The scaling factor applied before computing the softmax function in self-attention mechanisms, typically set as 1 / sqrt(headdim). This parameter is crucial for numerical stability during inference or training with Transformers.",
    "causal": "[_flash_attn_forward] Indicates whether to apply a causal mask (for autoregressive models) which restricts each position i from attending positions >i. It affects the attention mechanism by enforcing that tokens cannot attend future tokens, commonly used in language modeling tasks.",
    "window_size": "_flash_attn_forward Implements sliding window local attention where queries at any given index can only pay attention to keys within a specified range around it."
