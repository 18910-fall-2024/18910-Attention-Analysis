{
    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The number of sequences in a batch used for training or inference.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Sequence length, which determines the dimensions and shapes of input tensors like qkv. It also impacts attention model structure by defining how far back each query can attend to previous keys and values based on causal masking settings.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] The dimension size for each head in multi-head self-attention mechanisms, affecting the dimensions of input tensors such as qkv. It also impacts computational efficiency due to its role in scaling factors used within attention calculations (e.g., softmax_scale).",
    "nheads": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain] Number of heads in a MultiHeadAttention mechanism; this parameter determines how many parallel self-attention mechanisms are applied and thus affects the dimensions of input tensors like qkv.",
    "causal": "[flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, _flash_attn_forward functions] A boolean indicating whether causal attention is used. In practice for Transformers during inference or training with autoregressive models, this parameter shapes how queries attend to keys by applying a mask that prevents attending to future positions in the sequence.",
    "dropout_p": "[_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Dropout probability applied after computing softmax and scaling scores; it affects which elements are dropped out from input tensors during training for regularization purposes but does not affect tensor dimensions or shapes directly.",
    "softmax_scale": "_[_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Scaling factor used in the attention score computation (QK^T * scale). This parameter influences how dot products between query and key vectors are scaled, impacting computational efficiency. It is typically derived from head dimension size but can be explicitly set as a hyperparameter.",
    "window_size": "[_flash_attn_forward function call chain] Tuple defining the left and right window sizes for sliding window local attention; this parameter restricts each query's ability to attend only within its defined context, affecting computational efficiency by limiting interaction space between sequences."
