    "batch_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, config definition within for loop] The batch size of the input data in Transformer models.",
    "seqlen": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, config definition within for loop] The sequence length or number of tokens per sample in a batch. It is crucial as it defines how long each context window is considered during attention computation.",
    "headdim": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, config definition within for loop] Head dimension size which represents the dimensions of Q (query), K (key), and V (value) matrices per head in multi-head self-attention mechanisms. It influences model capacity and computational complexity.",
    "nheads": "[_flash_attn_forward function] Number of attention heads used in a Transformer layer, derived from `dim` and `headdim`. This hyperparameter determines the parallelism level within each transformer block's computation process.",
    "dropout_p": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func arguments] Dropout probability for regularization during training. It helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time.",
    "softmax_scale": "_flash_attn_forward (calculated if None) Scaling factor applied before the softmax operation in attention calculation, typically set as 1 / sqrt(headdim). This parameter is crucial for stabilizing gradients and numerical stability especially when dealing with large head dimensions.",
    "causal": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func arguments] Boolean indicating whether to apply causal masking (for autoregressive models like language modeling), but ignored as per the instruction. It ensures that each token only attends to previous tokens in sequence data processing tasks such as text generation.",
    "window_size": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func arguments] Tuple defining left and right window sizes for local attention mechanism if not (-1,-1). This parameter is crucial when implementing sliding-window or block-local self-attention mechanisms in transformers to limit the context size considered during computation.",
    "alibi_slopes": "[time_fwd_bwd function call chain, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func arguments] Slope values for ALiBi (Attention Layer with Biases) mechanism. It is used when implementing relative position biases or dynamic scaling factors based on distance between tokens in the sequence."
