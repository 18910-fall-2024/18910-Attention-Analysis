{
    "batch_size": "[code snippet starting point] Determines the batch size of input tensors to `flash_attn_2_cuda`. It is used in configuring different scenarios for benchmarking.",
    "seqlen": "[code snippet starting point] Specifies sequence length, determining the dimensions and shapes of QKV (Query-Key-Value) matrices passed into `flash_attn_2_cuda` functions. This parameter helps configure attention mechanism sizes during training or inference processes.",
    "headdim": "[code snippet starting point] Represents head dimension size for each multi-head in Transformers. It influences tensor dimensions fed to the Flash Attention CUDA kernel, affecting model architecture and performance tuning specifically related to memory usage and computational efficiency of self-attention mechanisms.",
    "nheads": "[code snippet starting point] Number of attention heads used by Transformer models; it is derived from `dim` (model dimension) divided by `headdim`. This parameter impacts the dimensions and shapes of tensors input into Flash Attention CUDA functions, influencing model capacity for parallel computation across multiple head streams.",
    "dropout_p": "[code snippet starting point] Dropout probability applied during training to prevent overfitting. It is passed directly as an argument to `_flash_attn_forward` function which in turn passes it down to `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd`. This parameter does not affect the tensor dimensions but influences attention mechanism's behavior.",
    "softmax_scale": "[code snippet starting point] Scaling factor used for QK^T before applying softmax. If None, defaults based on head dimension size (`headdim`). It is passed to `_flash_attn_forward` and further down to `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd`. This parameter affects the scaling of attention scores but does not directly influence tensor dimensions.",
    "causal": "[code snippet starting point] Indicates whether causal masking should be applied, which restricts each position in a sequence from attending to positions after it. Passed as an argument down through `_flash_attn_forward` and `flash_attn_2_cuda.fwd`. This parameter does not change tensor dimensions but affects the attention pattern.",
    "window_size": "[code snippet starting point] Defines local window size for sliding-window based self-attention mechanisms, passed to Flash Attention functions. It influences how far back or forward each position can attend within a sequence without affecting basic tensor dimensionality."
