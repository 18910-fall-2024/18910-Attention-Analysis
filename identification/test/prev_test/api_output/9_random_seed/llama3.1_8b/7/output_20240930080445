==================== Generated Output ====================
{"batch_size": "The batch size of input data.", 
"seqlen": "The sequence length of input data.",
"Headdim": "The head dimension used in the Transformer model, which determines the number of attention heads and their output dimensions.",
"deterministic": "Whether to use a deterministic implementation for backward pass computation. This parameter is related to training process with attention mechanism.", 
"return_attn_probs": "A boolean flag indicating whether to return attention probabilities during forward pass. This parameter has nothing to do with the size or shape of input tensors, so it's ignored.",
"window_size": "The window size used in sliding window local attention, which determines how much context each query can attend to.", 
"alibi_slopes": "A bias term added to attention scores based on the distance between queries and keys. This parameter is related to training process with attention mechanism."}
