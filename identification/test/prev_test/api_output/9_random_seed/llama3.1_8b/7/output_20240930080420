{ 
    "qkv_shape": "The shape of input tensor q, k, v to flash_attn_2_cuda. It is a 5D tensor with dimensions (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim).",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used in attention mechanism for training.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor of QK^T before applying softmax. Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim) when not provided.",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
    "window_size": "The size of sliding window local attention, if implemented. It is a tuple of left and right context sizes.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory. The forward pass is always deterministic.",
