  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling) in flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "window_size": "(left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. It determines the context window size used by flash_attn_2_cuda during training or inference with attention mechanism.",
