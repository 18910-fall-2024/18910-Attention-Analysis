==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** containing the extracted hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor of shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim) for flash attention",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used in flash attention forward and backward passes",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied to QK^T before softmax operation in flash attention",
    "causal": "Boolean flag indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied in flash attention",
    "window_size": "(left, right) tuple specifying the sliding window size for local attention in flash attention",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes used to compute alibi scores in flash attention forward pass",
    "deterministic": "Boolean flag indicating whether deterministic implementation of backward pass should be used in flash attention",
    "return_softmax": "Boolean flag indicating whether softmax probabilities and other outputs should be returned by flash_attn_qkvpacked_func"
}
```

Note that I have only extracted the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, which are:

- **qkv**: The input tensor shape for flash attention.
- **dropout_p**: Dropout probability used in forward and backward passes of flash attention.
- **softmax_scale**: Scaling factor applied before softmax operation in flash attention.
- **causal**: Boolean flag indicating whether causal mask should be applied during flash attention computation.
- **window_size**: Tuple specifying the sliding window size for local attention computations (if applicable).
- **alibi_slopes**: Bias slopes used to compute alibi scores during forward pass of flash attention.
- **deterministic**: Boolean flag controlling deterministic implementation of backward pass in flash attention.

These hyperparameters determine either input tensor shapes or sizes, dimensions, and structures that are fed into `flash_attn_2_cuda`, which is the final function call chain.
