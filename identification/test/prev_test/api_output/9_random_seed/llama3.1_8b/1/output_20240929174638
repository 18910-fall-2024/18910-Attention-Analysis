==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** containing the extracted hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensors in flash attention, used as an argument for forward and backward passes.",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length (or number of tokens) in each tensor passed into the forward pass of FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality of individual heads within a multi-head self-attention layer, used to calculate scaling factors and attention scores.",
    "nheads": "The total number of parallel attention heads (or sub-tasks) in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func. It's calculated as dim // headdim",
    "dropout_p": "A probability value between 0 and 1 that determines the dropout rate for each head during forward passes.",
    "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor applied to QK^T before applying softmax, used in _flash_attn_forward function. It's calculated as qkv.shape[-1] ** (-0.5) by default",
    "causal": "A boolean flag that determines whether causal attention masks are applied during forward passes.",
    "window_size": "The size of the sliding window for local self-attention, used in _flash_attn_forward function to implement local self-attention."
}
```

Note: I have ignored `deterministic` and `return_softmax`, as they do not affect the attention mechanism itself.
