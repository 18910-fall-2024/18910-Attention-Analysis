==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** with the list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape, (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim).",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function in attention calculation. Default to sqrt(headdim) if not provided.",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling)",
  "window_size": "(left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
  "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass (slower but uses more memory)",
  "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return attention probabilities. This option is for testing only."
}
```

Note that `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` function in the code snippet takes an input tensor shape as a parameter, which determines the size and dimension of tensors passed into `flash_attn_2_cuda`. Other parameters are related to attention mechanism calculation within `flash_attn_2_cuda`.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
