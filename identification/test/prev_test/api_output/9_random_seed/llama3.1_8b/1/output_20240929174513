==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** containing the extracted hyperparameters:

```
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor for flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which contains Q, K and V of attention mechanism.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability in attention mechanism. Should be set to 0.0 during evaluation.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor used before applying softmax function in attention mechanism.",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
    "window_size": "(left, right) If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i will only attend to keys between [i - left, i + right] inclusive.",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (|i-j|/2^slopes[i]) added to the attention score of query i and key j.",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, which is slightly slower and uses more memory.",
    "return_softmax": "Whether to return softmax probabilities. This option is for testing only.",
    "batch_size": "Size of batch input to attention mechanism",
    "seqlen": "Length of sequence input to attention mechanism"
}
```

Note: The hyperparameters are extracted from the function calls and definitions, especially those related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
