==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** containing the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). QKV input for flash attention.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. Used in training or inference with attention mechanism to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. Default value is 1 / sqrt(headdim), used as a hyperparameter for flash attention.",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling). Used in training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers.",
    "window_size": "(left, right) tuple. If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Used as a hyperparameter for flash attention to control the context window size during computation.",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to attention score of query i and key j. Used in training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers, to improve model performance by adding a bias term based on relative positions between queries and keys.",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of backward pass (slightly slower and uses more memory). Used as a hyperparameter during computation of flash attention's gradients.",
    "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for testing only, used in training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers."
}
```

Note that I've ignored boolean parameters like `return_format` and focused on those related to sizes, dimensions, shapes of input tensors, and model structures within `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
