==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters:

```
{
  "qkv_shape": "(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim) - The shape of input tensor qkv to flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "softmax_scale": "1 / sqrt(headdim) or None - A scaling factor for the attention scores. If not provided, it will be calculated as 1 / sqrt(head_dim).",
  "causal": "bool - Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "(left, right) - The size of sliding window local attention.",
  "alibi_slopes": "(nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32 - A bias added to the attention score based on the distance between query and key positions.",
  "dropout_p": "float. Dropout probability during training.",
  "deterministic": "bool - Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "return_softmax": "bool - Whether to return softmax output from flash_attn_2_cuda."
}
```

These hyperparameters are used for **training or inference** with the attention mechanism, especially for Transformers. They determine the input tensors' sizes, dimensions, and shapes (e.g., `qkv_shape`), or they influence the structure of the attention model in `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
