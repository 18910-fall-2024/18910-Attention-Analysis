==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output with all the relevant hyperparameters that are used for training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The number of sequences in each mini-batch. This parameter determines the batch dimension of input tensors to flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "seqlen": "The length of each sequence (number of tokens). This hyperparameter influences the size and shape of input tensors passed into flash_attn_2_cuda, affecting how attention is computed across sequences.",
  "headdim": "The dimensionality of individual heads within multi-head self-attention. Determines the internal representation of query-key-value vectors in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "nheads": "Number of parallel attention mechanisms used to compute output from input tensors passed into flash_attn_2_cuda, impacting model capacity and complexity.",
  "causal": "Flag indicating whether causal masking should be applied during self-attention computation. This parameter influences how context is aggregated in the forward pass through flash_attn_2_cuda for each position within sequences.",
  "window_size": "Tuple specifying left and right window boundaries (in terms of sequence positions) used to implement local attention mechanisms, affecting which contextual information contributes to output from flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "dropout_p": "Probability value controlling dropout regularization applied during self-attention computation in the forward pass through flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax normalization of query-key dot products within multi-head attention. This parameter affects how probabilities are computed and aggregated across different heads in flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "alibi_slopes": "List or tensor specifying slopes used to compute alibi bias terms added during self-attention computation, influencing the relative importance assigned to context from nearby positions within sequences.",
}
