==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensor qkv, which is used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length of input tensor qkv, which is used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "headdim": "The head dimension of attention model, which determines the size of each attention head. It's used in time_fwd_bwd, flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, and _flash_attn_forward.",
    "nheads": "The number of attention heads, which is calculated as dim // headdim in benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention/time_f_b -> .../benchmarks.benchmark_flash_attention.time_fwd_bwd. It's used indirectly through the calculation of nheads.",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask for auto-regressive modeling, which is a boolean hyperparameter but has significant impact on attention mechanism. It's used in time_fwd_bwd and flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
    "window_size": "The window size for sliding window local attention, which determines the context of each query position. If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. It's used indirectly through the calculation of out_padded in _flash_attn_forward.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A bias to be added to attention scores based on absolute difference between positions i and j. The slopes are fp32 numbers that determine the rate at which this bias increases with position difference. If not None, implements alibi attention. It's used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
    "softmax_scale": "The scaling factor of QK^T before applying softmax normalization. Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim). The scale is a float number that determines the magnitude of attention scores. If not None, implements custom scaling for attention mechanism. It's used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for training, which controls how much information is dropped during forward pass and backward pass. This hyperparameter has significant impact on model performance but does nothing with the attention mechanism directly. However, it affects the output of _flash_attn_forward indirectly through out and S_dmask."
