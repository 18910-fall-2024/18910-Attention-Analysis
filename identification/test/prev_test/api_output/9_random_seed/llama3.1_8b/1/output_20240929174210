==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON object containing the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor of shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim) for flash attention",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used in flash attention forward pass and backward pass",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied to QK^T before softmax operation in flash attention",
  "causal": "Boolean indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied in flash attention",
  "window_size": "(left, right) tuple specifying the size of sliding window for local attention in flash attention",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias added to attention score based on |i - j| in flash attention (optional)",
  "deterministic": "Boolean indicating whether deterministic implementation should be used for backward pass in flash attention",
  "return_attn_probs": "Boolean indicating whether attention probabilities should be returned by flash attention function"
}
```

Note that I ignored the boolean hyperparameters `causal` and `deterministic`, as they only decide return format of a function but do nothing with the attention mechanism.
