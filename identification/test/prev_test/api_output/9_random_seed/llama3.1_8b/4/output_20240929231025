  "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensors, which determines the number of sequences processed together.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length (number of tokens) in each tensor passed to flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads used for parallel computation and feature extraction. Determines how many independent sub-attention mechanisms are applied simultaneously, which affects the overall model capacity and computational complexity.",
  "headdim": "The dimensionality (number of features) in each head. Controls the number of distinct features learned by each attention mechanism within a multi-head setup",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal masking for autoregressive modeling or not, which affects how self-attention is computed and can impact model performance.",
  "window_size": "The size (left and right context) of the sliding window used in local attention. Controls what part of the input sequence each query attends to",
  "alibi_slopes": "A bias added to the attention score based on absolute difference between query and key indices, which can be useful for improving model performance or stability.",
