==================== Generated Output ====================
{"batch_size": "The batch size of input data.", 
"seqlen": "The sequence length of input data.",
"HeadDim": "The head dimension for multi-head attention mechanism in Transformers, used to split the query/key/value into multiple heads and compute their weighted sum. In this case, it's also related to flash_attn_2_cuda as an argument.", 
"nheads": "The number of attention heads in a Transformer model.",
"deterministic": "A boolean flag indicating whether to use deterministic implementation for backward pass or not. It doesn't affect the output directly but can influence performance and memory usage.", 
"window_size": "For sliding window local attention, it determines how many previous/future positions are considered as valid context when computing attentions.",
"softmax_scale": "The scaling factor applied before softmax computation in multi-head attention mechanism of Transformers. It's used to prevent exploding gradients during training."}
