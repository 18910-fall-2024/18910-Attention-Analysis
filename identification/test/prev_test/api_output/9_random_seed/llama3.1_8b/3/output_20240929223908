{ 
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input sequences for attention mechanism, used to determine tensor shape.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length (number of tokens) in each input sequence for attention mechanism, also determines the output dimension.",
  "headdim": "The head dimension or hidden dimension per attention head, which is a key hyperparameter determining model structure and capacity. It affects both forward and backward passes.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads (or parallel processing units), used to determine tensor shape and affect computation efficiency.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether causal masking should be applied during the self-attention mechanism, affecting how keys are weighted in the output. It determines if a model is autoregressive or not.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for attention weights to prevent overfitting and improve robustness against adversarial attacks, used for regularization purposes.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor applied before softmax normalization of attention scores, which affects the output distribution. It can be set manually as a hyperparameter or calculated internally based on model parameters (e.g., sqrt(head_dim)).",
  "window_size": "(left, right) tuple specifying sliding window size for local attention mechanism when causal=False; otherwise, (-1,-1). This parameter determines how far context is considered during the computation of attention weights.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes added to attention scores based on absolute position differences between query and key tokens. It can be used as a hyperparameter in some models for specific applications or set internally depending on model architecture."
