{"batch_size": "The batch size of input data.", 
"seqlen": "The sequence length of input data.",
"Headdim": "The head dimension, which is the number of attention heads in a Transformer model. It's used to determine the shape and size of tensors passed into `flash_attn_2_cuda`.",
"nheads": "The total number of attention heads in a Transformer model.", 
"deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation for backward pass, which is slightly slower but uses more memory.",
"return_softmax": "A boolean flag indicating whether the function should return softmax output. It's used to determine what kind of output `flash_attn_2_cuda` will produce."}
