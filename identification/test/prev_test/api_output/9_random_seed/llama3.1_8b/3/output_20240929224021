    "batch_size": "The batch size of input sequences, used for attention mechanism.", 
    "seqlen": "The length of input sequence in terms of number of tokens or elements., used for attention mechanism.", 
    "nheads": "Number of heads (attention mechanisms) to be applied simultaneously. Each head applies the same operation on different subspaces of the input data, which is useful when dealing with multi-modal inputs such as text and images together.",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality or size of each attention mechanism's output vector in a multi-head self-attention setup.", 
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal (auto-regressive) masking for the input sequences, which is useful when training models that predict future values based on past ones.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used during forward pass of attention mechanism. This helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out units with a certain probability.", 
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied to QK^T before applying softmax, which is useful for preventing the explosion or underflow of values in the denominator.",
    "window_size": "The size (left and right) of sliding window local attention. If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.", 
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias added to the attention score based on absolute difference between query index i and key index j for each head in multi-head self-attention setup.",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation of backward pass. This is useful when training models that require reproducibility.", 
    "return_attn_probs": "Whether to return attention probabilities, which are used during testing or evaluation phases."
