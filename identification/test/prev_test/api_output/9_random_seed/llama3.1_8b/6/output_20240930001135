{"batch_size": "The batch size of input sequences for attention mechanism.", 
"seqlen": "The sequence length of input sequences for attention mechanism.",
"Headdim": "The dimensionality of each head in the multi-head self-attention layer, which determines the output shape and capacity of the model.",
"nheads": "The number of heads in the multi-head self-attention layer, which controls how many parallel computations are performed simultaneously to increase throughput.", 
"causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether causal attention is applied or not. If True, only previous tokens can attend to current token; if False, all tokens can attend each other.",
"window_size": "The size of the sliding window for local self-attention mechanism in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.", 
"deterministic": "A boolean flag indicating whether deterministic implementation is used or not. If True, backward pass will be slightly slower and use more memory; if False, faster but non-deterministic.",
"dropout_p": "The dropout probability for attention scores to prevent overfitting in training phase."}
