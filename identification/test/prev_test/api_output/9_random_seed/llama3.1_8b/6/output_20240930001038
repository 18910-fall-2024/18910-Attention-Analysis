{ 
    "qkv_shape": "The shape of input tensor qkv, which is used to compute attention. It should be (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim).",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for the output of flash_attn_2_cuda.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for QK^T before applying softmax in flash_attn_2_cuda. It is set to sqrt(headdim) by default.",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask, which prevents an input element from attending to any subsequent elements within the same sequence.",
    "window_size": "The size of sliding window local attention for query at position i will only attend to keys between [i - window_size[0], i + window_size[1]] inclusive.",
    "alibi_slopes": "Bias added to the attention score, which is used in flash_attn_2_cuda. It can be a tensor of shape (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads).",
    "deterministic": "Whether to use deterministic implementation for backward pass, which uses more memory but runs slightly slower.",
    "return_softmax": "A boolean flag indicating whether the output should include softmax probabilities in addition to attention output."
