    "batch_size": "The batch size of input data, used as a dimension for tensors qkv and v in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",

    "nheads": "Number of attention heads, calculated from headdim by dividing dim into nheads.",
    "headdim": "The dimension for each head of self-attention mechanism, used as a hyperparameter in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func to calculate flops and determine the size of tensors qkv",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling). Used in _flash_attn_forward function.",
    "window_size": "If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Used as a hyperparameter in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func",

    "deterministic": "Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass, which is slightly slower and uses more memory. The forward pass is always deterministic. Used as a hyperparameter in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc",
    "return_softmax": "Whether to return softmax (possibly with different scaling). It also encodes the dropout pattern (negative means that location was dropped, non-negative means it was kept). Used in _flash_attn_forward function.",
    "softmax_scale": "The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax. Default is 1 / sqrt(headdim), used as a hyperparameter in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func"
