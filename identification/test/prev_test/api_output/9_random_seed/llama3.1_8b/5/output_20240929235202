{"batch_size": "The batch size of input sequence, which is used for training or inference with attention mechanism.", 
"seqlen": "The length of the input sequence, which determines the sizes and shapes of tensors in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
"HeadDim": "The dimensionality of each head in the multi-head self-attention module. It's related to the size of tensor QKV",
"NHeads": "Number of attention heads used for parallelization. This is a key parameter that determines the structure and efficiency of transformer models.", 
"causal": "Whether to apply causal mask or not, which affects how keys are weighted in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
"deterministic": "A flag indicating whether deterministic implementation should be used during backward pass",
"softmax_scale": "The scaling factor for softmax normalization. This is related to the attention mechanism and determines how scores from different heads are combined."}
