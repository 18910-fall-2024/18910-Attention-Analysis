{"batch_size": "The batch size of input tensor qkv.", 
"seqlen": "The sequence length of input tensor qkv.",
"HeadDim": "The dimension of each head in the multi-head attention mechanism. Used to calculate softmax scale and alibi slopes.",
"nheads": "The number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.",
"causal": "A boolean indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied during inference or training with auto-regressive modeling.", 
"deterministic": "A boolean controlling the implementation used for backward pass, which can affect memory usage and speed. This is only relevant when calculating gradients of loss function using backpropagation."}
