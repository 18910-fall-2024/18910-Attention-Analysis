{ 
    "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensor qkv, which determines the number of sequences processed together in a single forward pass.",
    "seqlen": "The sequence length of each input sequence in the tensor qkv, determining how many positions are considered for attention computation.",
    "headdim": "The dimensionality (i.e., size) of individual heads within multi-head self-attention layers used by Transformers. It influences both forward and backward computations through flash_attn_2_cuda",
    "nheads": "Determines the number of parallel, independent attention mechanisms applied to different subspaces of input features.",
    "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether causal masking should be enforced in self-attention operations for autoregressive modeling purposes. This affects both forward and backward computations through flash_attn_2_cuda",
    "window_size": "If set to a non-infinite value, it enables sliding window local attention by restricting the scope of each query's attentions within [i - left_window, i + right_window] positions.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A bias term added to attention scores based on relative position between queries and keys. It can be used for various purposes like masking or weighting different regions in sequences."
