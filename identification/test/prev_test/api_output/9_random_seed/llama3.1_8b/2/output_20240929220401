{ 
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input sequences for attention mechanism, used to determine the shape of tensors in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "seqlen": "The length of input sequence for each sample in a mini-batch, which determines the shape of output tensor from _flash_attn_forward function and thus affects the input shapes of flash_attn_2_cuda",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads used to split QKV into multiple sub-spaces for parallel computation. This parameter is crucial as it influences the structure of the model in flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "headdim": "The dimension size of each head, which determines how many features are processed simultaneously by a single attention mechanism instance",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling), used as input argument in _flash_attn_forward function and thus affects the computation process within flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "window_size": "The size of sliding window local attention, if not (-1,-1) it implements this mechanism. This parameter is crucial to determine how much context each query attends to",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes added to attention scores for alibi attention. These values are used as input argument in _flash_attn_forward function and thus influence the computation process within flash_attn_2_cuda.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability, which is a crucial hyperparameter affecting training stability of models using dropout mechanism",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for QK^T before applying softmax. This value determines how much attention scores are scaled and thus influences the computation process within flash_attn_2_cuda."
