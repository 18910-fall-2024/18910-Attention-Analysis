==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor containing query, key, and value embeddings. The shape should be (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim * 3).",
    "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for the attention mechanism.",
    "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor to stabilize the softmax computation in the attention mechanism.",
    "causal": "Whether to use causal masking in the self-attention layer. If True, only attend to previous tokens.",
    "window_size": "The window size used in the local attention mechanism. It should be a tuple of two integers representing the width and height of the window respectively.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A list of slopes for each alibi block in the self-attention layer."
}
```

Note that I have ignored boolean hyperparameters like `return_softmax` which only decide return format but do nothing with attention mechanism.
