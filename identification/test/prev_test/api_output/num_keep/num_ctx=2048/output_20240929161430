==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the code snippet's hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, specifically for those determining tensor sizes, dimensions, or shapes:

```json
{
  "qkv_shape": "Input query-key-value tensors shape; should be (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim) and will be split into three parts: q, k, v.",
  "window_size": "Window size in the attention mechanism for flash_attn_2_cuda. It determines how many positions to look at when computing self-attention weights.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used during training of flash_attn_2_cuda; will be ignored if set to zero."
}
```

Here is a brief explanation of each parameter:

1. **qkv_shape**: This hyperparameter represents the input query-key-value tensors shape, which should be `(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)`. The `flash_attn_forward` function splits this tensor into three parts: q (query), k (key), and v (value). In other words, it determines how to split a single tensor into multiple smaller ones for attention computation.
2. **window_size**: This hyperparameter is used in the attention mechanism of flash\_attn_2_cuda. It specifies how many positions should be considered when computing self-attention weights.

Note: I ignored `causal`, `deterministic`, and other boolean parameters that do not affect tensor sizes, dimensions, or shapes directly related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
