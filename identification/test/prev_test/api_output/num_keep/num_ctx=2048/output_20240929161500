==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and their descriptions:

```json
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor q, k, v for the attention mechanism in flash_attn_forward function. It's used as input tensors' sizes or dimensions.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability hyperparameter in forward method of FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc class and _flash_attn_forward function. It determines whether to apply dropout during training.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax operation in the attention mechanism. If None, it's set as qkv.shape[-1] ** (-0.5).",
    "causal": "Boolean hyperparameter indicating causal or non-causal self-attention mask used in flash_attn_forward function and forward method of FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc class.",
    "window_size": "Hyperparameters specifying the window size for attention mechanism, which is a tuple (size1, size2) representing different sizes along two dimensions. It's used to generate masks during training or inference.",
    "alibi_slopes": "Slope values of alibi lines in flash_attn_forward function and forward method of FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc class. These slopes are used for scaling the attention weights.",
    "deterministic": "Boolean hyperparameter indicating whether to use deterministic or stochastic version of attention mechanism during training."
}
