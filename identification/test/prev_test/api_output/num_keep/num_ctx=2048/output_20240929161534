==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and their descriptions:

```json
{
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used in attention mechanism. Used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward()",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function. If None, it will be set as the reciprocal of the square root of sequence length (qkv.shape[-1]). Used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward()",
    "causal": "Flag indicating whether to use causal attention or not. Used in _flash_attn_forward(), FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and flash_attn_cuda.fwd(). If True, it will be used for self-attention.",
    "window_size": "Window size for local windowed attention mechanism. It should have two values: [left_window_size, right_window_size]. Used in _flash_attn_forward(), FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and flash_attn_cuda.fwd().",
    "alibi_slopes": "List of slopes used to compute the alibi matrix for attention mechanism. It should have two values: [left_slope, right_slope]. Used in _flash_attn_forward(), FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.forward() and flash_attn_cuda.fwd.",
    "return_softmax": "Flag indicating whether return softmax probabilities or not. If True, it will be returned along with the output of attention mechanism. Used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.backward().",
}
```

Note that I ignored `deterministic` as a hyperparameter since you asked to ignore boolean flags used for deciding function outputs but have no effect on attention mechanisms.

Also note that some parameters like `qkv_shape`, `dqkv_shape`, etc. are not included in the JSON output because they seem to be automatically determined by other variables and do not directly affect the input tensors' sizes, dimensions or shapes related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
