==================== Generated Output ====================
Here are the **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` that determine input tensors' sizes, dimensions, and shapes:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor of shape [batch_size, sequence_length, num_heads * (num_queries + num_keys + num_values)]",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention mechanism in the range (0.0, 1.0]",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor used to normalize the output of softmax function; if None, it will be set as sequence_length ** (-0.5)",
  "causal": "Boolean indicating whether causal masking should be applied during forward pass",
  "window_size": "[sequence length for keys and values, window size]",
  "alibi_slopes": "List or tuple of slopes used in alibi attention mechanism; if None, it will not be used.",
  "deterministic": "Boolean indicating whether to use deterministic version of the model during forward pass",
  "return_attn_probs": "Boolean indicating whether to return attention probabilities along with output"
}
```

Note that `qkv` is a tensor input and its shape determines the size, dimension, or structure of the input data.
