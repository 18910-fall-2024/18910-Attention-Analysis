==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "qkv": "Input tensor containing query, key, and value embeddings for the attention mechanism.",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used in training the model. Determines how many elements are randomly dropped during forward pass.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor applied to softmax output of attention scores. Used to prevent exploding gradients.",
    "causal": "Boolean indicating whether causal masking is applied to input sequences (e.g., for autoregressive models).",
    "window_size": "Tuple containing window sizes in two dimensions, used as a mask during forward pass.",
    "alibi_slopes": "List of slopes used by ALiBi attention mechanism. Determines the shape and structure of the attention weights.",
    "deterministic": "Boolean indicating whether to use deterministic or random initialization for model parameters.",
    "return_attn_probs": "Boolean indicating whether to return attention probabilities in addition to output tensor."
}
```

Note: I ignored `return_softmax` because it's a boolean hyperparameter that only decides the format of function outputs, but doesn't affect the training/inference process with attention mechanism.
