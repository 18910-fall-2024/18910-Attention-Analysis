==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
    "window_size": "The size (in tokens) of the window over which attention is applied.",
    "alibi_slopes": "A tensor containing slopes for alibi analysis. Used in attention mechanism.",
    "dropout_p": "Probability of dropping out a neuron during training, used to regularize attention weights.",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax function in the attention mechanism."
}
```

I identified these hyperparameters from the following code snippets:

* `window_size` is mentioned in `_flash_attn_forward`, where it's passed as an argument to `flash_attn_cuda.fwd`.
* `alibi_slopes` is used in _flash\_attn\_forward, and also appears in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.
* `dropout_p` is a hyperparameter that controls the dropout rate for attention weights. It's passed as an argument to `_flash_attn_forward`, which calls `flash_attn_cuda.fwd`.
* `softmax_scale` determines how much to scale softmax outputs, and appears in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc.

I ignored boolean hyperparameters like `return_softmax` that only decide the return format of a function but do nothing with attention mechanism.
