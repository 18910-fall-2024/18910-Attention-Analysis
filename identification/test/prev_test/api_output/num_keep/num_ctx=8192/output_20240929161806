==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** output of the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input data. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length (number of tokens) in each input sample. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, time_fwd_bwd, and flops.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads for the Transformer model. Calculated as dim // headdim where dim is a hyperparameter used to calculate nheads.",
  "headdim": "The dimension (size) per head in each attention head. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, time_fwd_bwd, and flops.",
  "causal": "A boolean indicating whether the attention mechanism should be causal or not. Causal means that a token can only attend to tokens on its right side.",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability for training the model with regularization. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func, time_fwd_bwd, and _flash_attn_backward.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor used before applying softmax attention weights. Default is sqrt(headdim) but can be overridden as a hyperparameter.",
  "window_size": "The size of the sliding window for local attention (if applicable). Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward.",
  "alibi_slopes": "A bias added to attention scores based on absolute difference between query and key indices. Used in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and _flash_attn_forward."
}
```

Note that I have ignored the boolean hyperparameters like `return_softmax` which only decide return format of a function but do nothing with the attention mechanism, as per your request.

Also note that some other hyperparameters mentioned in the code (like "dim") are not explicitly used to calculate or influence any tensor sizes or shapes directly related to flash_attn_2_cuda. Therefore they have been ignored from this list.
