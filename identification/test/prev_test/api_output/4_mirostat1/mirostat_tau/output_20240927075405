==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **all** **hyperparameters** that are related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, especially for those determining the input tensors' sizes, dimensions, and shapes.

The output will be in JSON structure as requested.
```
{
    "qkv": "QKV tensor with shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
    "dropout_p": "Dropout probability for attention",
    "softmax_scale": "Scaling of QK^T before applying softmax",
    "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask in `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` and finally passed on to `flash_attn_2_cuda()`",
    "window_size": "Window size (left, right) for sliding window local attention. Default is (-1, -1), meaning no windowing.",
    "nheads": "Number of heads in Multi-Head Attention mechanism (`torch.nn.MultiheadAttention`)",
    "headdim": "Dimension per head",
    "dim": "Model dimension (not used directly but calculates nheads and headdim for `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func`) (2048)"
}
