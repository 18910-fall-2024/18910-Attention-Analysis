==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **all** hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, along with brief descriptions:

```
{
    "batch_size": "Input batch size for attention mechanism in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
    "seqlen": "Length of the input sequence (number of time steps) for attention mechanism.",
    "nheads": "Number of attention heads to use, calculated by dim = 2048 and headdim."
}
```

Note that some variables/calculations may be shared among multiple functions. I have only extracted those directly associated with hyperparameters passed into `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` which eventually leads to the final output function name `flash_attn_2_cuda`.

Please note, these were deduced from pytorch's attention mechanism implementation within code snippets you provided.
Given attention mechanisms' general
utility across multiple models (like transformers), though differing in their specific details (`pytorch`, yformers.), 
 
Care has been taken to focus on shared configurable aspects between functions related `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
