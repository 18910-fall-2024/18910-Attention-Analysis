==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON containing the identified hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv": "Input tensor shape: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim). The input qkv tensor contains Q, K, and V matrices for attention mechanism.",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability. Used to implement dropout during training or inference with attention mechanism in Transformers.",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor used before applying softmax function during attention computation in Transformers. Default value is set based on the headdim dimension of input tensors.",
  "causal": "Boolean flag indicating whether causal attention mask should be applied (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling) or not during attention mechanism computation in Transformers.",
  "window_size": "(left, right). Used to implement sliding window local attention. Query at position i will only attend to keys between [i - left, i + right] inclusive.",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) added to the attention score of query i and key j during attention mechanism computation in Transformers.",
  "deterministic": "Boolean flag indicating whether deterministic implementation should be used (slightly slower but more memory-efficient) for backward pass or not",
  "return_attn_probs": "Optional return format: Return attention probabilities along with output tensors. Used only during testing, and the returned probabilities might not have correct scaling.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads in Transformers model architecture. Computed from headdim dimension (headdim = dim // nheads) based on input tensor shapes."
}
```

I listed all relevant hyperparameters used for training or inference with attention mechanism, especially for Transformers models.

Please note that some parameters were ignored as per your instructions:

- Boolean `return_format` flags in the code snippets which do not affect attention mechanisms.
- Hyperparameter values (e.g., `(32, 512)` for batch and sequence length) are not explicitly listed here; only their roles and purposes during training or inference with attention mechanism in Transformers models were described.
