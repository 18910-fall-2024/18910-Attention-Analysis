==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON object containing the extracted hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
  "qkv_shape": "Input tensor QKV has shape (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
  "dropout_p": "Dropout probability used in attention calculation",
  "softmax_scale": "Scaling factor for softmax operation in attention calculation",
  "causal": "Whether to apply causal attention mask",
  "window_size": "Sliding window size for local attention (left, right)",
  "alibi_slopes": "Bias slopes added to attention scores as a function of query-key distance",
  "nheads": "Number of heads in multi-head self-attention",
  "headdim": "Dimensionality of each head"
}
```

These hyperparameters are used for the following purposes:

* `qkv_shape`: Determines the size and shape of input tensor QKV to `flash_attn_2_cuda`.
* `dropout_p`, `softmax_scale`, `causal`, `window_size`, and `alibi_slopes` determine parameters in attention calculation.
* `nheads` and `headdim` determine dimensions and structure of the multi-head self-attention mechanism.

Note that these hyperparameters are used throughout the code snippets, especially in `_flash_attn_forward()` function.
