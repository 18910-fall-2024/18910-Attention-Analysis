==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a JSON of the identifying results:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size used for input to flash_attn_2_cuda, which determines the number of sequences in one mini-batch.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length (or window size) for each query and key tensor input into flash_attn_2_cuda from _flash_attn_forward function.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads used by the flash_attn_2_cuda, where the number of heads is calculated from headdim",
  "dropout_p": "The dropout probability during training for output embedding or attention weights in flash_attn_func and _flash_attn_forward respectively.",
  "softmax_scale": "A scaling factor to be multiplied with QK^T (q \* k) before applying softmax function, controlled by the argument 'softscale' of flash_qkvpacked_func",
  "return_softmax": "Boolean flag used in FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc's forward method indicating whether output attention probabilities or original outputs should be returned.",
  "causal", "_flash_attn_forward": {"The causal parameter determines if a mask is applied to the Q \* K matrix while applying softmax, used in _flash_attn_forward function to control its input tensor sizes (dimensionality)."}
}
```

Please note that I kept these values consistent with descriptions from your code and they might not be exactly suitable as JSON keys for generalisation of hyperparameters.
