Here is a list of hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```json
{
    "qkv": "input tensor shape for attention mechanism, (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)",
    "dropout_p": "probability of dropout in the attention mechanism",
    "softmax_scale": "scaling factor for softmax function in the attention mechanism",
    "causal": "bool indicating whether to apply causal attention mask or not",
    "window_size": "(left, right) tuple specifying sliding window local attention size",
    "alibi_slopes": "slope of bias added to attention score at each position (nheads,) or per sequence",
    "deterministic": "bool flag for deterministic backward pass implementation in the attention mechanism"
}
```

Let me explain the role and purpose of these hyperparameters:

1. **qkv**:
	* Used as input tensor shape for attention mechanism.
	* `flash_attn_qkvpacked_func` takes a packed QKV tensor with shape `(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)`.
2. **dropout_p**:
	* Probability of dropout applied to output tensors during training in the attention mechanism (if used for inference).
	* This hyperparameter is important as it controls how much regularization we want in our model.
3. **softmax_scale**:
	* Scaling factor for softmax function applied to QKV interactions before getting attention scores.
4. **causal**:
    * `bool` flag indicating whether causal masking should be used or not during the computation of attentions, especially with autoregressive models where information is only allowed to flow forward in time (and yet into each subsequent moment¡¯s future).
5. **window_size**: 
	* Used for local attention mechanism inside Transformers.
6. **alibi_slopes**:
    * Slope of bias added at different positions within the input sequence; defines how much should influence depend on position difference from query to its neighbor key-value pair and vice versa, useful especially in computational limitations setting such as device memory constraint that forces trade-off between more effective tuning value representations but compute resource heavy operation overheads.
7. **deterministic**:
    * Flags if backward pass over uncommon activations (during training phase used solely with custom learning) has been done deterministically or not; by doing forward & backprop sequentially, computational needs rising significantly.


In particular the parameter shapes associated clearly aren¡¯t exactly "hyperparameters" either however rather utilized as input tensor specifications conveniently accessible from outside via function name convention establishing input sources effectively differencing themselves off alongside types despite assisting same calculations ¨C graceful versus frank factorization optimizing better terminology coherence.
