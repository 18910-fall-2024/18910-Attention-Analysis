==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **identified hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, including their purposes and roles, in JSON format:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for the input tensor qkv. In this code snippet, it's used as an argument to the function flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of each input token in qkv. This is also passed into flash_attn_qkvpacked_func and affects its output shape",
  "headdim": "The dimensionality (width) for each head in QKV attention operation."
}
```

Here are the details on how I arrived at these hyperparameters:

1. `batch_size` - from the loop header where it is unpacked as a variable, `$bs_seqlen_vals`
   In that line: `for batch_size, seqlen in bs_seqlen_vals:`

2.`seqlen`: The same line as above.
 
3. `headdim`: As shown by this snippet
```python
qkv = torch.randn(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim,
                  device=device, dtype=dtype, requires_grad=True)
```
   Here it's one of the dimensions that we're randomly sampling for our QKV tensor.

4. `nheads`: Is determined by:
```python
qkv = torch.randn(batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim,
                  device=device, dtype=dtype, requires_grad=True)
```
   This line takes the dimensions of qkv and sets "the number heads" to be `dim // headdim`. 

Note that I've ignored all boolean hyperparameters used in these code snippets as per your request.
