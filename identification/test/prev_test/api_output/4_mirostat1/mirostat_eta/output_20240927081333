Here is a detailed analysis of the code snippets provided:

**Identified Hyperparameters:**

After analyzing the given code, I have identified the following hyperparameters that relate to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and are used for training or inference with attention mechanism in Transformers.

Here's how they appear across different function calls:
```python
{
	¡°batch_size¡±:¡±The batch size of input data, which determines the number of samples processed simultaneously by flash_attn_qkvpacked_func.¡±,
    "seqlen": ¡°Length of sequence to process at once. Determines memory efficiency in attention.",
    'headdim':¡®Dimension of each head in attention mechanism.',
    ¡®nheads¡¯:¡°Number of heads in Transformer¡¯s multi-head self-attention module. This value determines the number output layers that will be processed by ¡±,
	'window_size[0]': ¡°Left boundary of sliding window local attention (if applicable). Determines input shape to flash_attn_2_cuda when computing scores.¡± ,
    'window_size[1]'¡°Right boundary of sliding window local attention. Similar role as `left` in determining sizes related to\)flash_attn_2_cuda ¡±,
	"causal": "Flag indicating whether causal mask should be applied for auto-regressive modeling.",
    ¡°dropout_p¡±:¡±Probability that an element will take on the value of zero during dropout, instead being scaled and added to other output elements.¡± 
}
```
