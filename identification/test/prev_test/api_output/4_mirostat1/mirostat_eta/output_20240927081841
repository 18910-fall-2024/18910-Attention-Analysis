Here is a list of **hyperparameters** that are finally related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`, with their descriptions in the format you requested:


```json
{
  "window_size": "Specifies window size for implementing sliding window local attention (left, right) if not (-1, -1)",
  "alibi_slopes": "(nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32: A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to the attention score of query i and key j",
  "causal": "bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask in flash_attn_qkvpacked_func (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling)",
  "dropout_p": "float: dropout probability in Pytorch's `attention_pytorch` function, should be set to 0.0 during evaluation; also used as input argument in flash_attn_interface.FlashAttnQKVPackedFunc",
  "softmax_scale": "None or float: The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax (default=1 / sqrt(headdim))"
}
