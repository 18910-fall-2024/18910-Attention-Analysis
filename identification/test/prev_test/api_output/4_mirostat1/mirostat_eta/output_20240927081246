==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a **JSON** containing the hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda`:

```
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size of input tensor qkv, which determines the number of sequences processed in parallel.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length of input tensor qkv, which determines the maximum context window for attention computation.",
  "nheads": "The number of attention heads used in Transformer architecture.",
  "headdim": "The dimensionality of each attention head, which affects the overall computational complexity and memory usage.",
  "causal": "A boolean flag indicating whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).",
  "window_size": "A tuple specifying the left and right context window sizes for sliding window local attention. A value of (-1, -1) indicates an infinite context window.",
  "alibi_slopes": "An array or tensor containing slope values used to compute alibi bias in attention scores."
}
```

Note that I've only included hyperparameters related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` and ignored boolean flags like `return_softmax`.
