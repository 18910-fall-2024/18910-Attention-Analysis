==================== Generated Output ====================
Here is a list of **hyperparameters** related to `flash_attn_2_cuda` from code snippets, along with their descriptions:

```json
{
  "batch_size": "The batch size for input tensors. It should be an integer that defines the number of sequences or batches in a single data point.",
  "seqlen": "The sequence length for input tensors. It can be any positive integer to represent how many tokens are processed at each time step.",
  "nheads": "Number of attention heads used concurrently by Transformer models, which is useful when cases involve multiple queries from the same batch or token pairs for multiplexed transformer (MT) architecture",
  "headdim": "The size per head dimension in Transformers' model as specified under the module flash_attn.utils.head_dim and dim, to contain all input feature dimension used within this instantiations of dense linear transformations on each query key value triple.",
  "causal": "Boolean variable indicating whether causal mask should be applied during self-attention calculation or not."
}
```

Each **hyperparameter** is related to the sizes, dimensions, shapes of tensors input into `flash_attn_2_cuda`, and their role in describing attention model structure.
